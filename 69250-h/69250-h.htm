AN errant perusal of half the pages of
this little volume once caused me to
determine to eschew literary criticism
in the preface I was asked to write,
and to speak of the book solely according
to its historical and hence its intrinsic
value.</p>

<p class='c008'>Continual reading here and there, and, at length,
a careful examination of the work as a whole have
convinced me that several merits may be attributed
to the book which range themselves separately in
my mind and which are distinct and wholly unique
characteristics. They seem to me to be as follows:
the bare antiquarian value—as a relic, rare, and
old; the historical-literary value, as an expression
of the times in which it was written; and its purely
artistic worth, as a specimen of English novel
writing.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>The book was published, as the title page shows,
early in 1789, and the self-acknowledged author
was Mrs. Perez Morton whose maiden name was
Sarah Wentworth Apthorp. Miss Apthorp was
born in Braintree in 1759, and had, before her
marriage in 1777 with Mr. Morton, gained something
more than a local reputation as a clever
maker of rhymes, having contributed many poems
to the early <cite>New England Magazine</cite>—the first
periodical published in America. These, with
additional verses and short didactic essays, were
together brought out in 1823, under the title of
“My Mind and Its Thoughts.” The edition was
small, and sold entirely by subscription. Miss Apthorp
wrote over the pseudonym of “Philenia.”
Her longer poems, epics, are “Ouabi, or The Virtue
of Nature: an Indian Tale in Four Cantos,” and
“Beacon Hill,” in which is told the story of the
American Revolution. This last is said to have
moved Robert Treat Paine to designate her as the
“American Sappho.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In 1788, while Mr. and Mrs. Morton were occupying
the historical Taylor mansion in Dorchester, a
painful domestic tragedy occurred, which, taken in
connection with similar contingencies that were
happening in the society in which they moved,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xi'>xi</span>doubtless gave “Philenia” the impetus and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">raison
d’être</span></i> for the “Power of Sympathy,” published
anonymously the following year.</p>

<p class='c009'>Although evidently written with the purest motive,
the good people of that day were not anxious to
receive the lesson, probably because many of them
figured as examples. The edition was bought
up and destroyed,—as Drake remarks in his
“History of Roxbury”, “so effectually suppressed
that no copy is now known to exist.” With the exception
of the book now before me, I believe this to
be true.</p>

<p class='c008'>The condition of affairs in America, immediately
following the Revolution, was not what many suppose.
The people were not completely united in
raving against John Bull and his institutions. It
is true the lower classes and those of the middle
class, who had been excited into believing that delusive
and, for them, hypocritical motto; “No taxation
without representation”, or who had gained
or lost all through the late fratricidal struggle,
were thriving wonderfully on “spread eagle” patriotism
stimulated by “Yankee Doodle” and “Hail
Columbia”—which, today, unfortunately bandage
the eyes of America’s native civilization—and entertained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>a cordial hatred of England and all things
English. Later they were to sympathize with Mirabeau,
with Robespierre and others, and cry death to
that French King who had so lately saved them
from the dismal caprices of George III and his
ignorant and haughty ministers. Politically, they
gloried in the name of Democrat.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nevertheless, there existed an aristocracy in
America; an aristocracy that had refrained from becoming
Tory solely because personal interest demanded
that it should become rebel. Its members
were English in taste and manner, in their hearts
they were Royalists. They called themselves Federalists.
To this category belonged the Hancocks,
John Adams, Hamilton, perhaps even Washington
himself; and here we find the Apthorps and the
Mortons. They had a fondness for court and ceremony—thought
and culture were still colonial;
they talked of the American gentleman, while they
dreamed of the English nobleman; for all that,
there was a rapidly growing strain of independence,
of confidence in self. All of which qualities
have today evolved the best type of the American
lady and gentleman.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c009'>Early in the second half of the eighteenth century,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii'>xiii</span>a literary revolution was in progress in England:
sentimentalism, which so long had been
mistaken for sentiment, was given its proper place;
knightly romance was sneered at and shelved, the
hale hearty laughter of Fielding disturbed the
spinsters and gossip mongers sipping their tea in the
corners; Laurence Sterne, that sentimentalist in
realism, condemned in caricature what the foolish
thought he defended in truth; and Sheridan, the
hater of sham and conventionality, satirized the
social deformity of the times in drama, drawing
scenes and characters from real life as found in the
famous Pump-room at Bath.</p>

<p class='c009'>To the aristocracy—hence to the reading class—of
the young American republic this atmospheric
change, toned and tempered and with an influence
less radical, was transmitted. It cried out aloud
against the sham of character, while it maintained
the poetry of diction; it was realistic in subject,
romantic in method; it openly lauded the “Sentimental
Journey,” while it secretly emulated “Tom
Jones”; its aim was to portray life through truth
rather than art—but the latter often unconsciously
asserted itself; its grave defect was the attempt to
commingle art and moral philosophy. In this literary
atmosphere the “Power of Sympathy” was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span>written, in character and color colonial, indigenous,
to English soil, and true to humanity at all time.</p>

<p class='c008'>A little more than a century ago the style of
telling a story through the medium of epistles
was revived; it was thus Richardson wrote
“Clarissa Harlowe” and “Pamela,” and Fielding
his “Joseph Andrews.” In this form Mrs. Morton
sought to tell her story.</p>

<p class='c009'>Both Richardson and Fielding are famous for
the amount of detail with which they fetter some
otherwise natural descriptions leaving no opportunity
for the imagination. Tedious detail we do
not find in the pages of the “Power of Sympathy”—all
here is <em>not</em> written; the phraseology is well
balanced, paragraphing is handled with consummate
skill, the chapters are for the most part short, the
color suggestive; and if detail be employed at all,
it is only when the author waxes mildly pedantic—robbed
of which quality, she would not be true
to the humanity of her time.</p>

<p class='c009'>What then can I say of her diction? Simply that
it is of the best. To say so, is seemingly audacious.
The modern grammarian may dispute it. Yet
viewed against the background of her period and
station, taking her style all in all as a medium of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xv'>xv</span>vivid, natural expression, where the economy of attention
is second only to striking portrayal, where
elegance, simplicity, directness are ever present but
never obtrusive, there is reason enough for our remark.
An examination of the suicide’s letters alone
would excuse us from all prejudice in the matter.</p>

<p class='c008'>The “Power of Sympathy,” in facsimile form, is
surely a valuable acquisition to the antiquarian; to
the student of culture, the book is the realistic expression
of life of a people and an era that are by
no means lacking in interest and importance; and
to the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">littérateur</span></i>, it is not an unworthy example of
more than ordinary literary art.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Harrington</em> to <em>Worthy</em>.</p>

<p class='c012'>YOU may now felicitate me—I
have had an interview with the charmer I
informed you of. Alas! where were the
thoughtfulness and circumspection of my
friend <em>Worthy</em>? I did not possess them, and
am graceless enough to acknowledge it. He
would have considered the consequences, before
he had resolved upon the project. But
you call me, with some degree of truth, a
strange medley of contradiction—the moralist
and the amoroso—the sentiment and
the sensibility—are interwoven in my constitution,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>so that nature and grace are at continual
fisticuffs—To the point:—</p>

<p class='c009'>I PURSUED my determination of discovering
the dwelling of my charmer, and have at
length obtained access. You may behold
my Rosebud, but should you presume to
place it in your bosom, expect the force of
my wrath to be the infallible consequence.</p>

<p class='c009'>I DECLARED the sincerity of my passion—the
warmth of my affection—to the beautiful
<em>Harriot</em>—Believe me, <em>Jack</em>, she did not seem
inattentive. Her mien is elegant—her disposition
inclining to the melancholy, and yet
her temper is affable, and her manners easy.
And as I poured my tender vows into the
heart of my beloved, a crimson drop stole
across her cheek, and thus I construe it in
my own favor, as the sweet messenger of
hope:—</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>“DO not wholly despair, my new friend;
excuse the declaration of a poor artless
female—you see I am not perfectly contented
in my situation—(Observe, <em>Jack</em>, I have not
the vanity to think this distress <em>altogether</em>
upon my account)—Time may therefore disclose
wonders, and perhaps more to your
advantage than you imagine—do not despair
then.”</p>

<p class='c009'>SUCH vulgar, uncongenial souls, as that
which animates thy clay, cold carcase, would
have thought this crimson drop nothing more
than an ordinary blush. Be far removed
from my heart such sordid, earth-born ideas:
But come thou spirit of celestial language,
that canst communicate by one affectionate
look—one tender glance—more divine information
to the soul of sensibility than can be
contained in myriads of volumes!</p>

<p class='c009'>HAIL gentle <em>God</em> of <em>Love</em>! While thou
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>rivetest the chains of thy <em>slaves</em>, how dost thou
make them leap for joy, as with delicious <em>triumph</em>.
Happy enthusiasm! that while it
carries us away into captivity, can make the
heart to dance as in the bosom of content.
Hail gentle <em>God</em> of <em>Love</em>! Encircled as thou
art with darts, torments, and ensigns of cruelty,
still do we hail thee. How dost thou
smooth over the roughness and asperities of
present pain, with what thou seest in reversion!
Thou banishest the <em>Stygian</em> glooms of
disquiet and suspense, by the hope of approaching
Elysium—Blessed infatuation!</p>

<p class='c009'>I DESIRE you will not hesitate to pronounce
an <em>amen</em> to my Hymn to Love, as an
unequivocal evidence of your wish for my
success.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>LETTER II.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'><em>Worthy</em> to <em>Harrington</em>.</p>

<p class='c012'>“WISH you success”—In what?
Who is this lady of whom you have been talking
at such an inconsistent rate? But before
you have leisure to reply to these inquiries
you may have forgotten there is such a person,
as she whom you call <em>Harriot</em>—I have
seen many juvenile heroes, during my pilgrimage
of two and twenty years, easily inflamed
with new objects—agitated and hurried away
by the impetuosity of new desires—and at
the same time they were by no means famous
for solidity of judgement, or remarkable for
the permanency of their resolutions. There
is such a tumult—such an ebullition of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>brain in their paroxisms of passion, that this
new object is very superficially examined.
These, added to partiality and prepossession,
never fail to blind the eyes of the lover. Instead
of weighing matters maturely, and stating
the evidence fairly on both sides, in order
to form a right judgement, every circumstance
not perfectly coincident with your particular
bias, comes not under consideration,
because it does not flatter your vanity. “Ponder
and pause” just here, and tell me seriously
whether you are in love, and whether you
have sufficiently examined your heart to give
a just answer.</p>

<p class='c009'>DO you mean to insinuate that your declaration
of love hath attracted the affection of
the pensive <em>Harriot</em>? If this should be the
case, I wish you would tell me what you design
to do with her.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

</div>

<p class='c011'><em>Harrington</em> to <em>Worthy</em>.</p>
<div class='c013'><em>Boston.</em></div>

<p class='c012'>I CANNOT but laugh at your dull
sermons, and yet I find something in them
altogether displeasing; for this reason I permit
you to prate on. “Weigh matters maturely!”
Ha! ha! why art thou not arrayed
in canonicals? “What do I design to do
with her?” Upon my word, my sententious
friend, you ask mighty odd questions. I see
you aim a stroke at the foundation upon
which the pillar of my new system is reared—and
will you strive to batter down that pillar?
If you entertain any idea of executing such
talk, I foresee it will never succeed, and advise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>you timely to desist. What! dost thou think
to topple down my scheme of pleasure?
Thou mightest as well topple down the pike
of <em>Teneriffe</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>I SUPPOSE you will be ready to ask, why,
if I love <em>Harriot</em>, I do not marry her—Your
monitorial correspondence has so accustomed
me to reproof, that I easily anticipate this piece
of impertinence—But who shall I marry?
That is the question. <em>Harriot</em> has no father—no
mother—neither is there aunt, cousin,
or kindred of any degree who claim any kind
of relationship to her. She is companion to
Mrs. <em>Francis</em>, and, as I understand, totally dependent
on that lady. Now, Mr. <em>Worthy</em>, I
must take the liberty to acquaint you, that I
am not so much of a republican as formally to
wed any person of this class. How laughable
would my conduct appear, were I to trace
over the same ground marked out by thy immaculate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>footsteps—To be heard openly
acknowledged for my bosom companion, my
daughter of the democratick empire of virtue!</p>

<p class='c009'>TO suppose a smart, beautiful girl, would
continue as companion to the best lady in
Christendom, when she could raise herself to
a more eligible situation, is to suppose a solecism—She
might as well be immured in a
nunnery. Now, <em>Jack</em>, I will shew you my
benevolent scheme; it is to take this beautiful
sprig, and transplant it to a more favorable
soil, where it shall flourish and blossom under
my own auspices. In a word, I mean to remove
this fine girl into an elegant apartment,
of which she herself is to be the sole mistress.
Is this not a proof of my humanity and goodness
of heart? But I know the purport of
your answer—So pray thee keep thy comments
to thyself, and be sparing of your compliments
on this part of my conduct—for I do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>not love flattery. A month has elapsed since
my arrival in town. What will the revolution
of another moon bring forth?</p>

<p class='c012'>I HAVE somehow bewitched a

fellow too—and the youth expresses such
fondness and passion that I begin to feel
afraid even to pity him—for love will certainly
follow. I own to you I <em>esteem</em> him
very much, but must I go any farther? He
is extremely generous—polite—gay—and
I believe if you were to see him, your partiality
in his favor would exceed mine.</p>

<p class='c012'>ARE the rural pleasures of <em>Belleview</em>,
my dear friend, so engaging as to debar
us of the pleasure of your company forever?
Do your dear groves, and your books, still
employ your meditating mind? Serious sentimentalist
as you are, let me ask, whether a
Ball, a Concert or Serenade, would not afford
you the satisfaction of a contemplative walk
in your garden, listening to the love tales of
the melodious inhabitants of the air?</p>

<p class='c009'>RAILLERY apart—when shall I take upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>myself the honour to wait upon you here?—I
want to advise with you on certain points of
female conduct, and about my new dress—I
have heard you say, lessons to a volatile mind
should be fresh and fresh applied, because it
either pretends to despise them, or has a tendency
to degeneracy—Now you must know I
am actually degenerating for want of some of
your Mentor-like lessons of instruction. I
have scarcely any opinion of my own, these
fashions, changing about so often, are enough
to vitiate the best taste in the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>I FORGOT to tell you my brother has
been at home this month; but, from certain
indubitable symptoms, I suspect the young
man to be in love.</p>

<p class='c009'>HEIGHHO! what is become of <em>Worthy</em>?
The time of my liberty steals away, for you
know I was to have three or four months of

<p class='c011'><em>Harrington</em> to <em>Worthy</em>.</p>
<div class='c013'><em>Boston.</em></div>

<p class='c012'>ABASHED—confounded—defeated—I
waited upon my beloved with my head well
furnished with ready made arguments, to prevail
on her to acquiesce in my benevolent
schemes—she never appeared so amicable—grace
accompanied every word she uttered,
and every action she performed. “Think, my
love,” said I, in a tone something between
sighing and tears, and took her hand in a
very cordial manner,—“Think, my love, on
your present, unhappy, menial situation, in
the family of Mrs. <em>Francis</em>.” I enlarged on
the violence of my passion—expatiated most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>metaphysically on our future happiness; and
concluded by largely answering objections.
“Shall we not,” continued I, “obey the dictates
of nature, rather than confine ourselves
to the forced, unnatural rules of —— and —— and
shall the halcyon days of youth slip
through our fingers unenjoyed?”</p>

<p class='c009'>DO you think, <em>Worthy</em>, I said this to <em>Harriot</em>?—Not
a syllable of it. It was impossible—my
heart had the courage to dictate,
but my rebellious tongue refused to utter a
word—it faultered—stammered—hesitated.</p>

<p class='c009'>THERE is a language of the eyes—and we
conversed in that language; and though I
said not a word with my tongue, she seemed
perfectly to understand my meaning—for she
looked—(and I comprehended it as well as if
she had <em>said</em>)—Is the crime of dependence
to be expiated by the sacrifice of virtue?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>And because I am a poor, unfortunate girl,
must the little I have be taken from me?
“No, my love,” answered I, passionately, “it
shall not be.”</p>

<p class='c009'>OF all those undescribable things which influences
the mind, and which are most apt to
persuade—none is so powerful an orator—so
feelingly eloquent as beauty—I bow to
the all-conquering force of <em>Harriot’s</em> eloquence—and
what is the consequence? I
am now determined to continue my addresses
on a principle the most just, and the most
honourable.</p>

<p class='c009'>HOW amiable is that beauty which has its
foundation in goodness! Reason cannot contemplate
its power with indifference—Wisdom
cannot refrain from enthusiasm—and
the sneering exertions of Wit cannot render
it ridiculous. There is a <em>dignity</em> in <em>conscious
virtue</em> that all my independence cannot bring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>me to despise—and if it be beauty that subdues
my heart, it is this that completes the
triumph—It is here my pompous parade, and
all my flimsy subterfuges, appear to me in
their proper light. In fine, I have <em>weighed
matters maturely</em>, and the alternative is—<em>Harriot</em>
must be mine, or I miserable without
her.—I have so well weighed the matter that
even this idea is a flash of joy to my heart—But,
my friend, <em>after the lightning comes the
thunder</em>—my father is mortally averse to my
making any matrimonial engagement at so
early a period—this is a bar to my way, but
I must leap over it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. <em>Holmes</em> to Miss <em>Harrington</em>.</p>
<div class='c013'><em>Belleview.</em></div>

<p class='c012'>ALTHOUGH my attachment
to <em>Belleview</em> is not so romantick as your airy
pen has described it, I think its quiet and
amusements infinitely preferable to the bustle
and parade with which you are surrounded.</p>

<p class='c009'>THE improvements made here by my late
husband (who inherited the virtues of his parents,
who still protect me, and endeavour to
console the anguish of his loss by the most
tender affection) have rendered the charms of
<em>Belleview</em> superior in my estimation to every
gilded scene of the gay world.</p>

<p class='c009'>IT is almost vanity to pretend to give you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>a description of the beauty of the prospect—the
grandeur of the river that rolls through
the meadow in front of the house, or any
eulogium of rural elegance, because these
scenes are common to most places in the
country. Nature is everywhere liberal in dispersing
her beauties and her variety—and I
pity those who look round and declare they
see neither.</p>

<p class='c009'>A GREAT proportion of our happiness depends
on our own choice—it offers itself to
our taste, but it is the heart that gives it
relish—what at one time, for instance, we
think to be humour, is at another disgustful
or insipid—so, unless we carry our appetite
with us to the treat, we shall vainly wish to
make ourselves happy, “were I in a desert,”
says Sterne, “I would find wherewith in it to
call forth my affections—If I could do no
better, I would fasten them on some sweet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>myrtle, or seek some melancholy cypress to
connect myself to—I would court their shade
and greet them kindly for their protection—If
their leaves withered, I would teach myself
to mourn, and when they rejoiced, I would
rejoice along with them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I BELIEVE you could hardly find the way
to the summer house, where we have enjoyed
many happy hours together, and which you
used to call “<em>The Temple</em> of <em>Apollo</em>.” It is
now more elegantly furnished than it formerly
was, and is enriched with a considerable addition
to the library and musick.</p>

<p class='c009'>IN front of the avenue that leads to this
place, is a figure of Content, pointing with
one hand to the Temple, and with the other
to an invitation, executed in such an antique
style, that you would think it done either by
the ancient inhabitants of the country, or by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>the hand of a Fairy—she is very particular
in the characters she invites, but those whom
she invites she heartily welcomes.</p>

vanity to look with pity on those who voluntarily
remove from whatever agrees with <em>their</em>
ideas of pleasure. He who has no conception
of the beauties of the mind, will contemn a
person aukward or illfavoured; and one
whose store of enjoyment is drawn from affluence
and abundance, will be astonished at the
conduct of him who finds cause to rejoice,
though surrounded with inconvenience and
penury. Hence we judge of the happiness of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>others by the standard of our own conduct
and prejudices.</p>

<p class='c009'>FROM this misjudging race I retire, without
a sigh to mingle in their amusements, nor
yet disgusted at whatever is thought of sufficient
consequence to engage their pursuits. I
fly from the tumult of the town—from scenes
of boisterous pleasures and riot, to those of
quietness and peace, “where every breeze
breathes health, and every sound is the echo
of tranquillity.”—On this subject I give my
sentiments to you with freedom, from a conviction
that I bear the world no spleen; at
the same time with a degree of deference to
the judgement of others, from a conviction
that I may be a little prejudiced.</p>

<p class='c009'>I HOPE to be with you soon—in the
meantime continue to write.</p>

<p class='c012'>I HAVE had a conversation with
my father on the subject of early marriages,
but to no purpose—I will not be certain

One must be an adept to argue with him;

<p class='c012'>I AM very happy at present enjoying
the sweets of <em>Belleview</em> with our excellent
friend Mrs. <em>Holmes</em>. To dwell in this
delightful retreat, and to be blest with the
conversation of this amiable woman, cannot
be called solitude. The charms of Nature
are here beheld in the most luxuriant variety—it
is here, diversified with beautiful prospect,
the late Mr. <em>Holmes</em> planned his garden;
it is elegant, but simple. My time glides off
my hands most happily—I am sometimes
indulging my solitary reflections in contemplating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>the sublimity of the scenes around me—and
sometimes in conversation with <em>Eliza</em>
and the old people.</p>

<p class='c009'>THE old gentleman is a man of the most
benevolent heart; he continues to preach—is
assiduous in the duties of his profession, and
is the love and admiration of his flock. He
prescribes for the health of the body, as well
as that of the soul, and settles all the little disputes
of his parish. They are contented with
his judgement, and he is at once their parson,
their lawyer, and their physician.—I often
read in the little building that was finished by
his son. He was a man of an excellent taste,
and I have paid my tribute to his memory—It
is the same place that you used to admire,
and perhaps I improve more of my time in it
on that very account.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'><em>Mrs. Holmes</em> to <em>Myra</em>.</p>
<div class='c013'><em>Belleview.</em></div>

<p class='c012'>I SIT down to give you, my dear
<em>Myra</em>, some accounts of the visitants of today,
and their conversation. We are not always
<em>distinguished</em> by such company, but perhaps
it is sometimes necessary; and as it is a relaxation
from thought, it serves to give us more
pleasure in returning to the conversation of
people of ideas.</p>

<p class='c009'>MRS. <em>Bourn</em> assumes a higher rank in life
than she pretended to seven years ago.—She
then walked on foot—she now, by good fortune,
rides in a chariot. Placed, however, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>a situation with which her education does not
altogether comport, she has nothing disagreeable
but her over assiduity to please—this is
sometimes disgusting, for one cannot feast
heartily upon honey: It is an errour which a
candid mind easily forgives. She sometimes
appears solicitous to display her mental accomplishments,
and desirous to improve those
of her daughter; but it is merely apparent.
Notwithstanding a temporary wish may arise
toward the attainment of this point, a habitual
vacancy nips it in the bud.</p>

<p class='c009'>MISS <em>Bourn</em> is about the age of fourteen—genteel,
with a tolerable share of beauty, but
not striking—her dress was elegant, but
might have been adjusted to more advantage—not
altogether aukward in her manner,
nor yet can she be called graceful—she has
a peculiar air of drollery which takes her by
fits, and for this reason, perhaps, does not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>avail herself of every opportunity of displaying
the modesty of her sex—she has seen
much company, but instead of polishing her
manners, it has only increased her assurance.</p>

<p class='c009'>THUS much of the characters of our company.
After some small chat which passed as
we took a turn in the garden, we entered the
Temple.</p>

<p class='c009'>“WHAT books would you recommend to
put into the hands of my daughter?” said Mrs.
<em>Bourn</em>, as she walked into the library—“it is
a matter of some importance.” “It is a
matter of more importance,” answered <em>Worthy</em>,
“than is generally imagined, for unless a
proper selection is made one would do better
never to read at all:—Now, Madame, as
much depends on the choice of books, care
should be taken not to put those in the way
of young persons, which might leave on their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>minds any disagreeable prejudices, or which
has a tendency to corrupt their morals.”—“As
obvious as your remark is,” added Mr.
<em>Holmes</em>, “it is evidently over looked in the
common course of education. We wisely exclude
those persons from our conversation,
whose characters are bad, whose manners are
depraved, or whose morals are impure: but if
they are excluded from an apprehension of
contaminating our minds, how much more
dangerous is the company of those books,
where the strokes aimed at virtue are redoubled,
and the poison of vice, by repeatedly
reading the same thing, indelibly distains the
young mind?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“WE all agree,” rejoined <em>Worthy</em>, “that it
is as great a matter of virtue and prudence
to be circumspect in the selection of our
books, as in the choice of our company.—But,
Sir, the best things may be subverted to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>an ill use. Hence we may possibly trace the
course of the ill tendency of many of the
Novels extant.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“MOST of the Novels,” returned my
father, “with which our female libraries are
over run, are built on a foundation not always
placed on strict morality, and in the pursuit
of objects not always probable or praiseworthy.—Novels,
not regulated on the chaste
principles of true friendship, rational love,
and connubial duty, appear to me totally unfit
to form the minds of women, of friends, or
of wives.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“BUT, as most young people read,” says
Mrs. <em>Bourn</em>—“what rule can be <em>hit upon</em> to
make study always terminate to advantage?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“IMPOSSIBLE,” cried Miss, “for I read as
much as anybody, and though it may afford
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>amusement, while I am employed, I do not
remember a single word, when I lay down the
book.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“THIS confirms what I say of Novels,”
cried Mr. <em>Holmes</em>, addressing <em>Worthy</em> in a jocular
manner, “just calculated to kill time—to
attract the attention of the reader for an hour,
but leave not one idea on the mind.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I AM far from condemning every production
in the gross,” replied <em>Worthy</em>; “general
satire against any particular class, or order of
men, may be viewed in the same light as a
satire against species—it is the same with
books—if there are corrupt or mortified
members, it is hardly fair to destroy the whole
body. Now I grant some Novels have a bad
tendency, yet there are many which contain
excellent sentiments—let these receive
their deserved reward—let those be discountenanced;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>and if it is impossible “to
smite them with an apoplexy, there is a moral
certainty of their dying of a consumption.”—But,
as Mrs. <em>Bourn</em> observes, most young persons
read, I will recommend to those who
wish to mingle instruction with entertainment,
method and regularity in reading. To <em>dip</em>
into <em>any book</em> burthens the mind with unnecessary
lumber, and may rather be called a
disadvantage, than a benefit—The record of
memory is so scrawled and blotted with imperfect
ideas, that not one legible character
can be traced.</p>

<p class='c009'>“WERE I to throw my thoughts on this
subject,” said my good father-in-law, as he began
to enter more and more warmly into the
debate—drawing his chair opposite <em>Worthy</em>,
and raising his hand with a poetical enthusiasm—“Were
I to throw my thoughts on
this subject into an Allegory, I would describe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>the human mind as an extensive plain, and
knowledge as the river that should water it.
If the course of the river be properly directed,
the plain will be fertilized and cultivated to
advantage; but if books, which are the sources
that feed this river, rush into it from every
quarter, it will overflow its banks, and the
plain become inundated: When, therefore,
knowledge flows on in its proper channel,
this extensive and valuable field, the mind, instead
of being covered with stagnant waters,
is cultivated to the utmost advantage, and
blooms luxuriantly into a general efflorescence—for
a river properly restricted by high
banks, is necessarily progressive.”</p>

<p class='c009'>THE old gentleman brought down his
hands with great solemnity, and we complimented
him on his poetical exertion. “I cannot
comprehend the meaning of this matter,”
said the penetrative Miss <em>Bourn</em>. “I will explain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>it to you, my little dear,” said he, with
good nature—“If you read with any design to
improve your mind in virtue and every amiable
accomplishment, you should be careful to read
methodically, which will enable you to form an
estimate of the various topicks discussed in
company, and to bear a part in all those conversations
which belong to your sex—you
see, therefore, how necessary general knowledge
is—what would you think of a woman
advanced in life, who has no other store of
knowledge than what she has obtained from
experience?” “I think she would have a
sorry time of it,” answered Miss.</p>

<p class='c009'>“TO prevent it in yourself,” said Mrs.
<em>Bourn</em> to her daughter, “be assiduous to lay
in a good stock of this knowledge, while your
mind is yet free from prejudice and care.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“HOW shall I <em>go to work</em>, Madam?” enquired
the delicate daughter.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>MRS. <em>Bourn</em> turned toward Mr. <em>Holmes</em>,
which was hint enough for the good old man
to proceed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“THERE is a medium to be observed,” continued
he, “in a lady’s reading; she is not to
receive everything she finds, even in the best
books, as invariable lessons of conduct; in
books written in an easy, flowing style, which
excel in description and the luxuriance of
fancy, the imagination is apt to get heated—she
ought, therefore, to discern with an eye
of judgement, between the superficial and
penetrating—the elegant and the tawdry—what
may be merely amusing, and what may
be useful. General reading will not teach her
a true knowledge of the  world.</p>

<p class='c009'>“IN <em>books</em> she finds recorded the faithfulness
of friendship—the constancy of <em>true
love</em>, and even that honesty is the best policy.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>If virtue is represented carrying its reward
with it, she too easily persuades herself that
mankind have adopted this plan: Thus she
finds, when, perhaps, it is too late, that she
has entertained wrong notions of human
nature; that her friends are deceitful—her
lovers false—and that men consult interest
oftener than honesty.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A YOUNG lady who has imbibed her
ideas of the world from desultory reading and
placed confidence in the virtue of others, will
bring back disappointment, when she expected
gratitude. Unsuspicious of deceit, she is
easily deceived—from the purity of her own
thoughts, she trusts the faith of mankind, until
experience convinces her of her errour—she
falls a sacrifice to her credulity, and her
only consolation is the simplicity and goodness
of her heart.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>“THE story of Miss <em>Whitman</em><a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c017'><sup>[1]</sup></a> is an emphatical
illustration of the truth of these observations.
An inflated fancy not restricted
by judgement, leads too often to <em>disappointment</em>
and repentance. Such will be the fate
of those who become (to use her own words)</p>

  </div>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. THIS young lady was of a reputable family in <span class='sc'>Connecticut</span>.
In her youth she was admired for beauty
and good sense. She was a great reader of novels and
romances, and having imbibed her ideas of <span class='fss'>THE CHARACTERS
OF MEN</span>, from those fallacious sources, became
vain and coquettish, and rejected several offers of marriage,
in expectation of receiving one more agreeable to
her fanciful idea. Disappointed in her <span class='fss'>FAIRY</span> hope,
and finding her train of admirers less solicitous for the
honour of her hand, in proportion as the roses of youth
decayed, she was the more easily persuaded to relinquish
that <span class='fss'>STABILITY</span> which is the honour and happiness
of the sex. The consequences of her amour becoming
visible, she acquainted her lover of her situation, and a
<span class='fss'>HUSBAND</span> was proposed for her, who was to receive a
considerable sum for preserving the reputation of the
lady; but having received security for payment, he
immediately withdrew. She then left her friends, and
travelled in the stage as far as <span class='sc'>Watertown</span>, where she
hired a young man to conduct her in a chaise to <span class='sc'>Salem</span>.
Here she wandered alone and friendless, and at length
repaired to the <span class='sc'>Bell-Tavern</span>, in <span class='sc'>Danvers</span>, where she
was delivered of a lifeless child, and in about a fortnight
after (in <span class='sc'>July</span>, 1788) died of a puerperal fever, age
about 35 years.</p>

<p class='c009'>Before her death she amused herself with reading,
writing and needlework, and though in a state of anxiety,
preserved a cheerfulness, not so much the effect of insensibility, as of patience and fortitude. She was sensible
of her approaching fate, as appears from the following
letter, which was written in characters.</p>

<p class='c009'>“MUST I die alone? Shall I never see you
more? I know that you will come, but you will come
too late: This is I fear, my last ability. Tears fall so,
I know not how to write. Why did you leave me in so
much distress? But I will not reproach you: All that
was dear I left for you; but do not regret it.—May
God forgive in both what was amiss: When I go from
hence, I will leave you some way to find me; if I die,
will you come and drop a tear over my grave?”</p>

<p class='c009'>In the following Poem, she, like the dying <span class='sc'>Swan</span>,
sings her own Elegy, and it is here added, as a sorrowful
instance, how often the best, and most pleasing talents,
not accompanied by virtue and prudence, operate the
destruction of their possessor.</p>

<p class='c009'>The description of her unfortunate passion, will remind
the critical reader of the famous ode of Sappho.
In genius and in misfortune, these poetical ladies were
similar.</p>

novelty; but these airy talents, not counterpoised
with judgement, or perhaps serious reflection,

were the cause of her ruin.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>“I CONCLUDE from your reasoning,”
said I, “and it is besides, my own opinion,
that many fine girls have been ruined by reading

may trace from hence the causes of spleen in

recollection of chagrin and former disappointment,

represents a caricature rather than a living
picture.” “It is the duty of a painter to produce
a likeness,” said <em>Worthy</em>,—“And a skilful
one,” cried my father, continuing the metaphor,
“will bring the amiable qualities of the
heart to light; and throw those which disgrace
humanity into the shade.” “I doubt,”
rejoined <em>Worthy</em>, “whether this flattery will
answer the purpose you aim to accomplish—You
entertain a high opinion of <em>the dignity of
human nature</em>, and are displeased at the
author who advances anything derogatory to
that dignity. <em>Swift</em>, in speaking of these
maxims, in one of his best poems, affirms,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“They argue no corrupted mind</div>
      <div class='line'>In him—the fault is in mankind.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“AS I began this subject,” added I, “it
shall be ended by one observation—As these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>maxims give us an idea of the manners and
characters of men, among whom a young person
is soon to appear; and as it is necessary
to her security and happiness that she be
made acquainted with them—they may be
read to advantage.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“THERE is another medium,” said Mr.
<em>Holmes</em>, assenting to my observation, “to be
noticed in the study of a lady—she takes up
a book, either for instruction or entertainment—the
medium lies in knowing when to put it
down. Constant application becomes labour—it
sours the temper—gives an air of
thoughtfulness, and frequently of absence.
By <em>immoderate reading</em> we hoard up opinions
and become insensibly attached to them; this
miserly conduct sinks us to affectation, and
disgustful pedantry; <em>conversation</em> only can remedy
this dangerous evil, strengthen the judgement,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>and make reading really useful. They
mutually depend upon, and assist each other.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A KNOWLEDGE of HISTORY which
exhibits to us in one view the rise, progress
and decay of nations—which points out the
advancement of the mind in society, and the
improvements in the arts which adorn human
nature, comes with propriety under the notice
of a lady. To observe the origin of civilization—the
gradual progress of society, and
the refinements of manners, policy, morality
and religion—to observe the progress of
mankind from simplicity to luxury, from luxury
to effeminacy, and the gradual steps of
the decline of empire, and the dissolution of
states and kingdoms, must blend that happy
union of instruction and entertainment, which
never fails to win our attention to the pursuit
of all subjects.</p>

<p class='c009'>“POETRY claims her due from the ladies.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>POETRY enlarges and strengthens the mind,
refines the taste and improves the judgement.
It has been asserted that women have no business
with <em>satire</em>—now satire is but a branch
of poetry. I acknowledge, however, much
false wit is sent into the world, under this
general title; but no critick with whom I am
acquainted ever called satire false wit—for as
long as vice and folly continue to predominate
in the human heart, the satirist will be considered
as a useful member of society. I believe
<em>Addison</em> calls him an auxiliary to the pulpit.
Suffer me to enlarge on this <em>new idea</em>. Satire
is the correction of the vices and follies of the
human heart; a woman may, therefore, read
it to advantage. What I mean by enforcing
this point, is, to impress the minds of females
with a principle of self correction; for among
all kinds of knowledge which arise from reading,
the duty of self-knowledge is a very eminent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>one; and is at the same time, the most
useful and important.</p>

<p class='c009'>“OUR ordinary intercourse with the world,
will present to us in a very clear point of view,
the fallacious ideas we sometimes entertain of
our own self-knowledge.—We are blinded by
pride and self love, and will not observe our
own imperfections, which we blame with the
greatest acrimony in other people, and seem
to detest with the greatest abhorrence; so
that, it often happens, while we are branding
our neighbour for some foible, or vanity, we
ourselves are equally guilty.</p>

<p class='c009'>“RIDICULOUS as this conduct must
appear in the eyes of all judicious people, it is
too frequently practised to escape observation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I WILL drop this piece of morality, with
a charge to the fair reader, that whenever she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>discovers satire, ridiculing or recriminating
the follies or crimes of mankind, that she look
into her own heart, and compare the strictures
on the conduct of others with her own feelings.”</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Mrs. Holmes</em> to <em>Myra</em>.</p>
<div class='c013'><span class='sc'>In Continuation.</span></div>

<p class='c012'>MY good father-in-law being
so strenuous in proving the eligibility of reading
satire, had spurn out, what he called his
<em>new idea</em>, to such a metaphysical nicety, that
he unhappily diminished the number of his
hearers; for Mrs. <em>Bourn</em>, to whom he directed
his discourse, had taken down a book and was
reading to herself, and Miss was diverting herself
with the cuts in <em>Gay’s</em> Fables.</p>

<p class='c009'>A CONSIDERABLE silence ensued,
which <em>Worthy</em> first broke, by asking Mrs.
<em>Bourn</em> what book she had in her hand.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>Everyone’s attention was alarmed at this important
enquiry. Mrs. <em>Bourn</em>, with little difficulty,
found the title page, and began to read.
“<cite>A Sentimental Journey through France and
Italy, by Mr. Yorick.</cite>”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I DO not like the <em>title</em>,” said Miss <em>Bourn</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>“WHY, my dear!” apostrophized the
mother, “you are mistaken—it is a very
famous book.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“WHY, my dear!” retorted the daughter,
“It is sentimental—I abominate everything
that is sentimental—it is so unfashionable
too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I NEVER knew before,” said Mr. <em>Holmes</em>,
“that wit was subject to caprice of fashion.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“WHY ’Squire <em>Billy</em>,” returned Miss,
“who is just arrived from the centre of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>politeness and fashion, says the bettermost
genii never read any sentimental books—so
you see sentiment is out of date.”</p>

<p class='c009'>THE company rose to go out.—</p>

<p class='c009'>“SENTIMENT out of date!” cries
<em>Worthy</em>, repeating the words of Miss <em>Bourn</em>,
and taking the book from her mother, as she
walked towards the door—“Sentiment out of
date—alas! poor <em>Yorick</em>—may thy pages
never be soiled by the fingers of prejudice.”
He continued his address to them, as they
went out, in the same <em>Shandean</em> tone—“<em>These</em>
antisentimentalists would banish thee
from the society of all books! Unto what a
pitiful size are the race of <em>readers</em> dwindled!
Surely these <em>antis</em> have more to do with thee,
than the gods of the Canaanites—In character
and understanding they are alike—eyes
have <em>they</em>, but they see not—ears have <em>they</em>,
but they hear not, neither is there any knowledge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>to be found in them.” “It is hardly
worth while to beat it into them,” said my
father-in-law, “so let us follow the company.”</p>

<p class='c009'>WE did so—they walked toward the
house, and <em>Worthy</em> and myself brought up
the rear.</p>

<p class='c009'>I COULD not but remark, as we went on,
that Miss <em>Bourn</em> had spoken the sentiments
of many of her sex;—“and whence,” said I to
<em>Worthy</em>, “arises this detestation of books in
<em>some</em> of us females, and why are <em>they</em> enemies
to anything that may be called sentiment and
conversation: I grant it often happens there
is such rapidity of speeches that one may be at
a loss to distinguish the speakers; but why is
there such a calm silence, should an unfortunate
sentiment inadvertently”—“I will tell
you,” interrupted he, “You all read, and it is
from the books which engage your attention,
that you generally imbibe your ideas of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>principal subjects discussed in company—now,
the books which employ your hours of
study, happen to be Novels; and the <em>subjects</em>
contained in these Novels are commonly confined
to <em>dress</em>, <em>balls</em>, <em>visiting</em>, and the like <em>edifying</em>
topicks; does it not follow, that these
must be the subjects of your conversation? I
will not dispute whether the Novel makes the
woman, or the woman makes the Novel; or
whether they are written to engage your attention,
or flatter your vanity. I believe the
results will shew they depend, in some measure,
upon each other; and an uninformed
woman, by reading them, only augments the
number of her futile ideas. <em>The female mind</em>,
notwithstanding, <em>is competent to any talk</em>, and
the accomplishments of an elegant woman
depend on a proper cultivation of her intelligent
powers; a barrenness—a sterility of conversation—immediately
discovers where this
cultivation is wanting.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>“GIVE me leave,” answered I, “to espouse
the cause of this class of females. Tell me
candidly, Mr. <em>Worthy</em>, whether that insipid
flattery, perhaps sacrificed at the expense of
truth, does not misguide many of us into erroneous
paths? You declare we are handsome—and
your conduct demonstrates you
to be more solicitous for the possession of
<em>beautiful</em>, than of <em>mental</em> charms. Hence is
the deluded female persuaded of the force of
her fascinating powers, and vainly imagines,
one glance of her eye sufficient to reduce a
million of hearts whenever she chooses: Her
aims, therefore, are confined to the decoration
of her person, and her views centre solely
in finishing herself in those attractive, all-powerful
graces, with which you declare yourselves
to be enchanted. How then are they
to be censured for neglecting to improve
the mind, when your adulation diverts their
attention to an external object?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>“I JOIN with you,” replied <em>Worthy</em>, “in
calling it insipid flattery—and the vain cox-comb,
the powdered beau, the insignificant
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petit maître</span></i>, are those who make use of it.
Will women of real merit, and sound sense,
believe what is said by <em>them</em> to be <em>their</em> real
sentiments?—No—There must be a congeniality
in the minds of those who give and
receive flattery—Has not the vain coquette
as much inclination to be thought a goddess,
as the empty admirer to declare her so?</p>

<p class='c009'>“FLATTERY is become a kind of epidemical
distemper: many run into it, perhaps,
without designing it, or only through civility.
There are some women who expect it—who
dress to be admired—and who deem it a
mark of impoliteness and rudeness in men,
who do not pay them the tribute of compliment
and adulation. A man of sense <em>may</em>
comply with their expectation—he will still
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>think them agreeable <em>playthings</em>, to divert
him at an hour of relaxation; but I cannot
suppose he will entertain any serious thoughts
of <em>a more permanent connection</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>“MAY we not conclude these things to be
productive of many evils that happen in society—do
they not frighten all sentiment
from conversation—introduce affectation—pride—envy—clandestine
marriages—elopements—division
of families—and ultimately
terminate in the ruin of very many
innocent, but inconsiderate females?”</p>

<p class='c009'>By this time we had got into the house,
and our company soon after departed, leaving
us at full leisure to contemplate on the many
wrong ideas entertained, and fallacious steps
pursued by the generality of mankind, in the
sentimental part of female education.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Worthy</em> to <em>Myra</em>.</p>
<div class='c013'><em>Belleview.</em></div>

<p class='c012'>A PEACEFUL, recluse life, is suited to my
temper—there is something in the soft
breath of Nature—in the delicacy of smiling
meadows and cultivated fields—in the sublimity
of an aged wood—of broken <span class='fss'>ROCKS</span>—of
rivers pouring along their lucid waves, to
which the heart always gives a ready reception—there
is something within us congenial to
these scenes; they impress the mind with
ideas similar to what we feel in beholding one
whom we tenderly esteem.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>I WAS making this observation to Mrs.
<em>Holmes</em>, and she told me I was in love—“These
are the very scenes,” said she, “which
your beloved <em>Myra</em> used to praise and admire,
and for which you, by a secret sympathy, entertain
the same predilection. The piece of
embroidery which she worked at an early age,
and which ornaments the Temple, I have seen
you gaze upon several times—you seem to
trace perfection in every part of it, because it
was executed by the hand of <em>Myra</em>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I ACKNOWLEDGE I have often gazed
upon it (as Mrs. <em>Holmes</em> terms it) but did not
recollect it to be a piece of your work. I
stole an opportunity to revisit it by myself
and I instantly remembered it—I remembered
when you finished it, and all the happy,
inoffensive scenes of our childhood, returned
fresh upon my heart.</p>

<p class='c009'>IT is the work <em>Myra</em>, said I to myself—Did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>not her fingers trace these beautiful expanding
flowers?—Did she not give to this
carnation its animated glow, and to this opening
rose its languishing grace? Removed as
I am—continued I in a certain interiour language
that every son of nature possesses—Removed
as I am, from the amiable object of
my tenderest affection, I have nothing to do
but to admire this offspring of industry and
art—It shall yield more fragrance to my soul
than all the <em>bouquets</em> in the universe.</p>

<p class='c009'>I DID not care to pursue the thought—it
touched a delicate string—at first, however,
I flattered myself I should gain some consolation—but
I lost in every reflection.</p>

<p class='c009'>I CONSIDERED the work as coming
from your hand, and was delighted the more
with it. A piece of steel that has been rubbed
with a loadstone, retains the power of attracting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>small bodies of iron: So the beauties of
this embroidery, springing from your hands,
continue to draw my attention, and fill the
mind with ideas of the artist.</p>

not all these in themselves bare, insignificant
words? The world has so long been accustomed

idea is lost. But to the question—What is
love? Unless it is answered now, perhaps it
never will be. Is it not an infinitude of graces
that accompany everything said by <em>Harriot</em>?
That adorn all she does? They must not be
taken severally—they cannot be contemplated

<p class='c012'>OUR little party was overthrown
by a strange piece of folley. A Miss
P—— was introduced, a young lady of beauty
and elegant accomplishments. The whole
company were beginning to be cheerful—business
and care were disgusted at the sight
of so many happy countenances, and had gone
out from among us. Jollity and good humour
bade us prepare for the dance—unhappily at
this juncture a lady and a gentleman were engaged
in a conversation concerning Miss
P——, and one of them repeated the words
“a mechanick’s daughter”—it is supposed the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>word “mechanick” was repeated scornfully—She
heard it—thought herself insulted—and
indignantly retired—disorder and confusion
immediately took place, and the amusement
was put an end to for the evening.</p>

<p class='c009'>I WISH people would consider how little
time they have to frollick here—that they
would improve it to more advantage, and not
dispute for any precedence or superiority but
in good nature and sociability—“a mechanick”—and
pray whence the distinction!</p>

<p class='c009'>INEQUALITY among mankind is a foe
to our happiness—it even affects our little
parties of pleasure—Such is the fate of the
human race, one order of men lords it over
another; but upon what grounds its right is
founded I could never yet be satisfied.</p>

<p class='c009'>FOR this reason, I like a democratickal
better than any other kind of government;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>and were I a <em>Lycurgus</em> no distinction of rank
should be found in my commonwealth.</p>

<p class='c009'>IN my tour through the United States, I
had an opportunity of examining and comparing
the different manners and dispositions
of the inhabitants of the several republicks.
Those of the southern states, accustomed to a
habit of domineering over their slaves, are
haughtier, more tenacious of honour, and indeed
possess more of an aristocratick temper
than their sisters of the confederacy. As we
travel to the northward, the nature of the constitution
seems to operate on the minds of the
people—slavery is abolished—all men are declared
free and equal, and their tempers are
open, generous and communicative. It is the
same in all those countries where the people
enjoy independence and equal liberty. Why
then should those distinctions arise which are
inimical to domestick quietude? Or why
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>should the noisy voice of those who seek distinction,
so loudly reecho in the ears of peace
and jollity, as to deafen the sound of the musick?
For while we are disputing who shall
lead off the dance, behold! the instrument gets
out of tune—a string snaps—and where is
our chance for dancing?</p>

cannot but lament their deplorable situation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>when they discover how egregiously they

who thought himself fascinated by
beauty, when he finds he has unknowingly
been charmed by reason and virtue!</p>

<p class='c009'>BUT this you will say contains a sentiment
of jealously, and is but a transcript of my
apprehensions and gloomy anxieties: When
will your preference, like the return of the
sun in the spring, which dispels glooms, and
reanimates the face of nature, quiet these
apprehensions? If it be not in a short time, I
shall proceed on a journey to find you out;
until then I commit you to the care of your
guardian angel.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Harrington</em> to <em>Harriot</em>.</p>
<div class='c013'><em>Boston.</em></div>

<p class='c012'>LAST night I went on a visit
to your house: It was an adventure that
would have done honour to the Knight of <em>La
Mancha</em>. The moon ascended a clear, serene
sky, the air was still, the bells sounded the
solemn hour of midnight—I sighed—and
the reason of it I need not tell you. This
was, indeed, a pilgrimage; and no <em>Musselman</em>
ever travelled barefooted to <em>Mecca</em> with more
sincere devotion.</p>

<p class='c009'>YOUR absence would cause an insufferable
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennui</span></i> in your friends, were it not for the art
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>we have in making it turn to our amusement.
Instead of wishing you were of our party, you
are the goddess in whose honour we performed
innumerable <em>Heathenish</em> rites. Libations of
wine are poured out, but not a guest presumes
to taste it, until they implore the name of
<em>Harriot</em>; we hail the new divinity in songs,
and strew around the flowers of poetry. You
need not, however, take to yourself any extraordinary
addition of vanity on the occasion
as your absence will not cause any repining:</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>BUT to give you <em>my</em> opinion on this important
matter, I must descend to plain truth, and
acknowledge I had rather adore you a <em>present</em>
mortal, than an <em>absent</em> divinity; and therefore
wish for your return with more religious
ardour than a devout disciple of the false
prophet for the company of the <em>Houri</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>THANKS to the power of imagination for

  <h2 class='c007'>LETTER XXI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'><em>Harriot</em> to <em>Myra</em>.</p>
<div class='c013'><em>Rhodeisland.</em></div>

<p class='c012'>WE arrived here in safety, but
our journey is not without incident—an incident
which exhibits a melancholy picture of
the wickedness and depravity of the human
heart.</p>

<p class='c009'>WHEN we came to the house of Mrs.
<em>Martin</em>, who I suppose you know is cousin to
Mrs. <em>Francis</em>, we were not a little astonished
at the evident traces of distress in her countenance;
all her actions were accompanied
with an air of solemnity, and her former gaiety
of heart was exchanged for sad, serious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>thoughtfulness: She, however, put on a face
of vivacity upon our being introduced, but her
cheerfulness was foreign to the feelings of her
heart.</p>

<p class='c009'>MR. <em>Martin</em> was equally agitated: he endeavoured
to dispossess himself of an <em>uncommon</em>
weight of remorse, but in vain—all his dissimulation
could not conceal his emotion, nor
his art abate the continual upbraidings of
conscious guilt.</p>

<p class='c009'>MRS. <em>Francis</em> was anxious to enquire the
cause of this extraordinary change, but wisely
forebore adding to the distress of her friend,
by desiring her to explain it, in a manner too
precipitate. She was in a short time made
acquainted with the particulars of the story—which
is not more melancholy than uncommon.</p>

<p class='c009'>SOMETIME after the marriage of <em>Martin</em>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>the beautiful <em>Ophelia</em>, sister to Mrs. <em>Martin</em>,
returned from a European visit to her friends
in <em>Rhodeisland</em>. Upon her arrival, she received
a polite offer from her brother-in-law
of an elegant apartment of his house in
town, which was cheerfully accepted—Fatal
acceptation! He had conceived a passion for
<em>Ophelia</em> and was plotting to gratify it. By a
series of the most artful attentions, suggested
by a diabolical appetite, he insinuated himself
into her affection—he prevailed upon the
heart of the unsuspicious <em>Ophelia</em>, and triumphed
over her innocence and virtue.</p>

<p class='c009'>THIS incestuous connection has secretly
subsisted until the present time—it was interrupted
by a symptom which rendered it
necessary for <em>Ophelia</em> to retire into the country,
where she was delivered of a child, at once
the son and nephew of <em>Martin</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>THIS event was a severe mortification to
the proud spirit of <em>Shepherd</em>, the father of
<em>Ophelia</em>. His resentment to his daughter was
implacable, and his revenge of the injury
from <em>Martin</em> not to be satiated. The blaze
of family dispute raged with unquenchable
fury—and poor <em>Ophelia</em> received other punishment
from the hand of a vindictive father
than base recrimination.</p>

<p class='c009'>THE affection of <em>Martin</em> now became
changed to the vilest hatred.</p>

<p class='c009'>THUS doomed to suffer the blackest ingratitude
from her seducer on the one hand,
and to experience the severity of paternal
vengeance on the other—and before her the
gloomy prospect of a blasted reputation—what
must be the situation of the hapless
<em>Ophelia</em>! Hope, the last resort of the
wretched, was forever shut out. There was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>no one whom she durst implore by the tender
name of father, and he, who had seduced her
from her duty and her virtue, was the first to
brand her with the disgraceful epithets of undutiful
and unchaste.</p>

<p class='c009'>PERHAPS it was only at this time, that
she became fully sensible of her danger; the
flattery and dissimulation of <em>Martin</em> might
have banished the idea of detection, and
glossed over that of criminality; but now she
awoke from her dream of insensibility, she
was like one who had been deluded by an
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ignis fatuus</span></i> to the brink of a precipice, and
there abandoned to his reflection to contemplate
the horrours of the sea beneath him,
into which he was about to plunge.</p>

<p class='c009'>WHETHER from the promises of <em>Martin</em>,
or the flattery of her own fancy, is unknown,
but it is said she expected to become his wife,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>and made use of many expedients to obtain a
divorcement of <em>Martin</em> from her sister: But
this is the breath of rumour: Allowing it to
be truth, it appears to be the last attempt of
despair; for such unnatural exertions, with
the compunction attending them, represent a
gloomy picture of the struggle between sisterly
affection and declining honour. They
however proved inavailable, and her efforts to
that end, may with propriety be deemed a
wretched subterfuge.</p>

<p class='c009'>IN the mean while the rage of <em>Shepherd</em>
was augmenting. Time, instead of allaying,
kindled the flame of revenge in the breast of
the old man. A sense of the wounded honour
of his family, became every day more exquisite;
he resolved to call a meeting of the
parties, in which the whole mystery should be
developed—that <em>Ophelia</em> should confront her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>seducer, and a thorough enquiry and explication
be brought about.</p>

<p class='c009'>OPHELIA exercised all her powers to prevent
it; she intreated her father to consent to
her desire, but her tears and entreaties were
vain. To this earnest desire of his daughter,
<em>Shepherd</em> opposed the honour of his family.
She replied that a procedure would publish
its disgrace and be subversive of his intention:
That she hoped to live retired from the world,
and it was in his power to accept her happy
repentance: In extenuating, she wished not
to vindicate her errours, but declared herself
to be penetrated with a melancholy sense of
her misconduct, and hoped her penitence
might expiate her guilt: She now beheld the
sin in the most glaring colours, the dangers to
which she had been exposed, and acknowledged
the effects of her temerity had impressed
her mind with sincere contrition: “All
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>persons,” continued she, “are not blest with
the like happiness of resisting temptation:” she
intreated her father, therefore, to believe her
misfortunes proceeded from credulity and not
from an abandoned principle—that they
arose more from situation than a depraved
heart: In asking to be restored to the favour
and protection of a parent, she protested she
was not influenced by any other motive, than
a wish to demonstrate the sincerity of her
repentance, and to establish the peace and
harmony of the family.</p>

<p class='c009'>OPHELIA now became melancholy, and
her intentions visibly bent on the <em>manner of
her death</em>. As the time drew nigh, her sensibility
became more and more exquisite:
What was before distress, she now averred to
be horrour: Her conduct bordered on insanity.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>THE day was appointed to bring to a
settlement this unhappy business—the time
of hearing arrived—the parties met—the
presence of <em>Ophelia</em> was necessary—she was
missing—the unfortunate <em>Ophelia</em> died by her
own hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>MRS. <em>Shepherd</em> entered the apartment of her
daughter—she beheld her pale and trembling—she
saw the vial, and the cup with the remains
of the poison—she embraced her lost—“<em>My
Ophelia!</em> my daughter! return—return
to life.”</p>

<p class='c009'>AT this crisis entered the father—he was
mute—he beheld his daughter struggling
with the pangs of dissolution—he was dumb
with grief and astonishment.</p>

<p class='c009'>THE dying <em>Ophelia</em> was conscious of the
distress of her parents, and of her own situation—she
clasped her mother’s hand, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>raising her eye to heaven, was only heard to
articulate “LET MY CRIME BE FORGOTTEN
WITH MY NAME.—O
FATAL! FATAL POISON!”</p>

<p class='c009'>ADIEU! my dear <em>Myra</em>—this unhappy
affair has worked me to a fit of melancholy.
I can write no more. I will give you a few
particulars in my next. It is impossible to
behold the effect of this horrid catastrophe
and not be impressed with feelings of sympathetick
sorrow:</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c007'>LETTER XXII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'><em>Harriot</em> to <em>Myra</em>.</p>
<div class='c013'><em>Rhodeisland.</em></div>

<p class='c012'>HOW frail is the heart! How
dim is human foresight! We behold the
gilded bait of temptation, and know not until
taught by experience, that the admission of
one errour is but the introduction of calamity.
One mistake imperceptibly leads to another—but
the consequences of the whole bursting
suddenly on the devoted head of an unfortunate
wanderer, becomes intolerable.</p>

<p class='c009'>HOW acute must be that torture, which
seeks an asylum in suicide! O SEDUCTION!
how many and how miserable are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>the victims of thy unrelenting vengeance.
Some crimes, indeed, cease to afflict when
they cease to exist, but SEDUCTION opens
the door to a dismal train of innumerable
miseries.</p>

<p class='c009'>YOU can better imagine the situation of
the friends of the unfortunate <em>Ophelia</em> than I
can describe it.</p>

<p class='c009'>THE writings she left were expressive of
contrition for her past transaction, and an
awful sense of the deed she was about to execute.
Her miserable life was insupportable,
there was no oblation but in death—she
welcomed death, therefore, as the pleasing
harbinger of relief to the unfortunate. She
remembered her once loved seducer with pity,
and bequeathed him her forgiveness.—To
say she felt no agitation was not just, but
that she experienced a calmness unknown to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>a criminal was certain. She hoped the rashness
of her conduct would not be construed to
her disadvantage—for she died in charity
with the world. She felt like a poor wanderer
about to return to a tender parent, and
flattered herself with the hopes of a welcome,
though unbidden return. She owned the
way was dark and intricate, but lamented she
had no friend to enlighten her understanding,
or unravel the mysteries of futurity. She
knew there was a God who will reward and
punish: She acknowledged she had offended
Him, and confessed her repentance. She expatiated
on the miserable life she had <em>suffered</em>:
not that she feared detection, that was impossible:
but that she had been doing an injury to
a sister who was all kindness to her: she
prayed her sister’s forgiveness—even as she
herself forgave her seducer; and that her
crime might not be called ingratitude, because
she was always sensible of her obligation to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>that sister. She requested her parents to
pardon her, and acknowledged she felt the
pangs of a bleeding heart at the shock which
must be given to the most feeling of mothers.
She intreated her sisters to think of her with
pity, and died with assurance that her friends
would so far revere her memory as to take up
one thing or another, and say this belonged to
poor <em>Ophelia</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>O MY friend! what scenes of anguish are
here unfolded to the survivours. The unhappy
<em>Shepherd</em> charged <em>Martin</em> with the seduction
and murder of his daughter. What
the termination of this most horrible affair
will be, is not easy to foresee.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>

<p class='c011'><em>Harriot</em> to <em>Myra.</em></p>
<div class='c013'><em>Rhodeisland.</em></div>

<p class='c012'>WHATEVER may be the
other causes (if there were any besides her
seduction) which drove the unhappy <em>Ophelia</em>,
temerariously to end her existence, it certainly
becomes us, my dear friend, to attend to them—and
to draw such morals and lessons of instruction
from each side of the question, as
will be a mirrour by which we may regulate
our conduct and amend our lives. A prudent
pilot will shun those rocks upon which others
have been dashed to pieces, and take example
from the conduct of others less fortunate than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>himself: It is the duty of the moralist, then to
deduce his observations from preceding facts
in such a manner as may directly improve the
mind and promote the economy of human
life.</p>

<p class='c009'>THIS may be an apology for sending you
the arguments of <em>Martin</em> in answer to <em>Shepherd</em>,
who in his rage and grief had called him
the murderer of his child.</p>

<p class='c009'>HE reminded <em>Shepherd</em> of his obstinacy
in persisting in an explanatory meeting, and
refusing to grant <em>Ophelia’s</em> request in suffering
the affair to subside—“Your proud
spirit,” said he, “would not harken to the gentle
remonstrances of your daughter—your
heart was closed to every conciliatory proposition.
Though she expressed a propensity
to fly from the eye of the world, she had
hitherto appeared lulled in a kind of happy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>insensibility; yet the approaching time of explanation
was terrible, it renewed the story
and torture of all her misfortunes, and the
idea filled her with grief and dismay. Had
you been as willing to receive her, as she to
return to you, happy would it have been for
both; but your pride was the cause of additional
calamities—when the time arrived—But
why shall we harrow upon souls with the
reiteration of her sorrowful exit?—</p>

<p class='c009'>“FROM these circumstances,” said <em>Martin</em>,
“you cannot accuse me as the <em>immediate</em>
cause of <em>Ophelia’s</em> death; the facts are as I
have stated them—and thus was a straying,
but penitent child, driven to despair and suicide
by a severe use of parental power, and a
vain attempt to resent an injury, for which it
was impossible the accused party could make
compensation.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>NOTWITHSTANDING the plausibility
of <em>Martin’s</em> plea, I have little hesitation in my
mind to charge him with the <em>remote cause</em> of
the miserable end of <em>Ophelia</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>HOW far parental authority may be extended,
is a question which I shall not determine;
I must, however, think it depends upon
the combination of circumstances. The duty
of a child to her parents will be in proportion
to the attention paid to her education. If, instead
of the usual pains bestowed by many
partial parents, upon the vain parade of forming
the manners of a child, and burthening
the mind with the <em>necessity</em> of douceurs and
graces, would it not often be happier for both,
to take a small share of thought to kindle <em>one
spark of grace</em> in the heart?</p>

<p class='c009'>HAPPY the parents, who have bestowed
upon their children such an education, as will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>enable them, by a principle of mediocrity, to
govern them without extorting obedience, and
to reclaim them without exercising severity.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>LETTER XXVI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'><em>Myra</em> to Mrs. <em>Holmes</em>.</p>
<div class='c013'><em>Boston.</em></div>

<p class='c012'>IN one of my former letters I acquainted
you that I suspected my brother to
be in love, and now Madam, I am enabled to
tell you with whom—the amiable <em>Harriot</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>Harriot</em> attended Mrs. <em>Francis</em> in her
journey to <em>Rhodeisland</em>, and our young hero
has, in her absence, been dreaming of his mistress;
and, in a letter to her has written a
description of his visionary interview. <em>Harriot</em>,
with whom I maintain a constant correspondence,
and who keeps no secret from me,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>inclosed the verses in her last, when lo! the
handwriting of Master <em>Harrington</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>I WAS a little mortified that the young
man had kept me in ignorance of his amour
all this time, and this morning determined
upon a little innocent revenge—“Tommy,”
said I, as he entered the room, “here is a
piece of poetry, written by an acquaintance
of mine—I want your judgment on it”—“Poetry
or rhyme,” answered he, advancing
towards me, and casting his eyes upon it—He
took the letter and began to read—“Why
do you blush, young man?” said I,
“<em>Harriot</em> is a fine girl.”—</p>

<p class='c009'>THIS produced an <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclaircissement</span></i>, and as
the matter must remain secret, for a certain
weighty reason, I am to be the <em>confidante</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>I MUST acknowledge to you, Mrs. <em>Holmes</em>,
there is a certain <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">je ne sais quoi</span></i> in my amiable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>friend, that has always interested her in
my favour—I have an affection for her which
comes from the heart—an affection which
I do not pretend to account for—Her dependance
upon Mrs. <em>Francis</em> hurts me—I do
not think this lady is the gentle, complaisant
being, that she appears to be in company—To
behold so fine a girl in so disagreeable a
situation, might at first attract my commiseration
and esteem, and a more intimate knowledge
of her virtues might have ripened them
into love. Certain it is, however, that whom
I admire as a friend, I could love as a
<span class='fss'>SISTER</span>. In the feelings of the heart there
can be no dissimulation.</p>

<p class='c009'>PLEASE to tell Mr. <em>Worthy</em>, he may continue
to write, and that I will condescend to
read his letters.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'><em>Worthy</em> to <em>Myra</em>.</p>
<div class='c013'><em>Belleview</em>.</div>

<p class='c012'>I AM just returned from a melancholy excursion
with <em>Eliza</em>. I will give you the history
of it—We generally walk out together,
but we this time went further than usual—The
morning was calm and serene—all
Nature was flourishing, and its universal harmony
conspired to deceive us in the length of
the way.</p>

<p class='c009'>WHILE we were pursuing our walk, our
ears were struck with a plaintive, musical
voice, singing a melancholy tune.—“This,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>said Mrs. <em>Holmes</em>, “must be <em>Fidelia</em>—the
poor distracted girl was carried off by a ruffian
a few days before her intended marriage,
and her lover, in despair, threw himself into
the river,”—<em>Eliza</em> could say no more—for
<em>Fidelia</em> resumed her melancholy strain in
the following words:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>TALL rose the lily’s slender frame,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>It shed a glad perfume;</div>
      <div class='line'>But ah! the cruel spoiler came,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And nipt its opening bloom.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Curse on the cruel spoiler’s hand</div>
      <div class='line in2'>That stole thy bloom and fled—</div>
      <div class='line'>Curse on his hand—for thy true love</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Is number’d with the dead.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Poor maiden! like the lily frail,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>’Twas all in vain you strove;</div>
      <div class='line'>You heard the stranger’s tender tale—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But where was thy true love?</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Thou wast unkind and false to him,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But he did constant prove;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>He plung’d headlong in the stream—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Farewel, farewel, my love!</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>’Twas where the river rolls along,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The youth all trembling stood,</div>
      <div class='line'>Opprest with grief—he cast himself</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Amidst the cruel flood.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>White o’er his head the billows foam,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And circling eddies move;</div>
      <div class='line'>Ah! there he finds a watery tomb—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Farewel, farewel, my love!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>WE advanced towards the place from
where the sound issued, and <em>Fidelia</em>, who
heard our approach, immediately rose from
the ground; “I was tired,” said she, “and sat
down here to rest myself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>SHE was dressed in a long white robe, tied
about the waist with a pink ribband; her fine
brown hair flowed loosely round her shoulders—In
her hand she held a number of wild
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>flowers and weeds, which she had been gathering.
“These,” she cried, “are to make a
nosegay for my love.” “He hath no occasion
for it,” said <em>Eliza</em>. “Yes! where he
lives,” cried <em>Fidelia</em>, “there are plenty—and
flowers that never fade too—I will throw
them into the river, and they will swim to
him—they will go straight to him”—“And
what will he do with them?” I asked; “O!”
said the poor girl as she looked wistfully on
them, and sorted them in her hand, “he loves
everything that comes from me—he told me
so”—“He will be happy to receive them,”
cried <em>Eliza</em>. “Where he is,” said <em>Fidelia</em>, “is
happiness—and happy are the flowers that
bloom there—and happy shall I be, when I
go to him—alas! I am very ill now”—“He
will love you again,” said <em>Eliza</em>, “when you
find him out”—“O he was very kind,” cried
she, tenderly, “he delighted to walk with me
over all these fields—but now, I am obliged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>to walk alone.” <em>Fidelia</em> drew her hand across
her cheek, and we wept with her.—“I must
go,” she said, “I must go,” and turned abruptly
from us, and left us with great precipitation.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>LETTER XXVIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'><em>Worthy</em> to <em>Myra</em>.</p>
<div class='c013'><em>Belleview.</em></div>

<p class='c012'>MY melancholy meditations led me
yesterday to the same place where I had seen
the distracted <em>Fidelia</em>, and walking down the
hill I again beheld her by the side of a beautiful
spring—Before I could come up to the
place, she was gone—she went hastily over
the field—I followed her—after a few minutes
walk, I overtook her, and we both went
on together towards a small, neat farmhouse.
An old man was sitting at the door—he gave
a sigh as she passed him to go in—I asked
him if she was his daughter—“Alas!” said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>he, “my poor child—she has been in this
state of affliction for near a twelve month.”
I enquired what cause produced the loss of
her senses—He looked down sorrowfully—the
question awakened the gloomy sensations
of past evils, the recollection of which was
painful, and opened wounds afresh that were
not yet healed. “She has lost her lover,”
cried the old man—“the youth was the son
of one of our neighbours—their infancy was
marked by a peculiar attachment to each
other. When the young people danced together,
<em>Fidelia</em> was always the partner of
<em>Henry</em>—as they grew up their mutual tenderness
ripened into passionate affection. They
were engaged to each other, and <em>Henry</em> saved
all his little stock of money to begin the
world by himself. All the town beheld them
with pleasure—they wished them success and
happiness—and from their knowledge of
both their characters, were led to hope they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>would one day become good members of
society—but these hopes are blasted, and
they now bestow the bitterest curses on the
wretch who hath crushed their expectations—who
hath deprived <em>Fidelia</em> of her senses, and
caused the death of her lover.</p>

<p class='c009'>“THE gay <em>Williams</em> comes among us, and
participates in our domestick pastimes—he
singles out <em>Fidelia</em>, and is assiduous in his attentions
to her—her little heart is lifted up—but
her prudence rises superior to her vanity.
<em>Henry</em> observes the operations of <em>Williams</em>
and thinks he sees in him a powerful
rival—the unhappy youth becomes melancholy—he
sickens with jealousy—the pleasures
of our country are forgotten by him—his
thoughts are constantly employed on his
<em>Fidelia</em>.—To complete the measure of his
promised happiness he wishes to call her his
own—he declares the desire of his soul-<em>Fidelia</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>pledges her faith. He now sees the
accomplishment of all his wishes in reversion—his
heart leaps for joy—but—as the little
paraphernalia is preparing, the ruffian hand of
the <span class='sc'>Seducer</span> dashes the cup of joy from their
lips—<em>Fidelia</em> suddenly disappears—<em>Williams</em>—the
ungrateful <em>Williams</em>—betrays her to
a carriage he had prepared, and she is hurried
off. <em>Henry</em> stands astonished—wild with
grief and dismay, he appears senseless and
confounded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“WHEN the heart is elevated by strong
expectation—disappointment and misfortune
come with redoubled force.—To receive pain,
when we look for pleasure, penetrates the
very soul with accumulated anguish.”</p>

<p class='c009'>THE old man paused—He endeavoured
to hide a tear that was stealing down his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>cheek—and to check the violence of his passion.</p>

<p class='c009'>I ASKED him how long his daughter was
missing—“Not long,” he answered—“the
young men, enraged at the insult, arm themselves
and pursue the robber—they overtake
him—<em>Williams</em> is wounded in the scuffle,
and is carried away bleeding, by his servant—My
daughter is regained—we thank
Heaven for her restoration. She enquires for
her <em>Henry</em>—alas! <em>Henry</em> is no more! The
object of his love had flown from him, and
with her the light of his soul—Darkness and
grief had encompassed him—he had no resource,
no consolation, no hope—she, whom
his soul loved was stolen—was wrested from
his embrace. Who was there to administer
relief?—Who was there to supply her loss?—Not
one.—the light of his reason now became
clouded—he is seized by despair, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>urged forward by the torments of disappointed
love, he plunges into the river—to close his
sorrows with his life.</p>

<p class='c009'>“THE loss of <em>Fidelia’s</em> senses followed this
tragical event.</p>

<p class='c009'>“SHE hears the fate of her lover and becomes
petrified—the idea of her sorrows—her
own agitation and care for her person,
are lost in the reflection of her lover’s death.—A
while she raved—but this is now somewhat
restored, and, as you see, the poor maniack
strays about the fields harmless and inoffensive.”</p>

<p class='c009'>THE old man proceeded to inform me of
the death of his wife—the idea of one misfortune
aroused in him that of another—or
rather there was a gradual progression in
them, and consequently a connexion—He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>told me she did not long survive the death of
<em>Henry</em>. “O <em>Charlotte!</em>” he cried, “thou wast
kind and cheerful—very pleasant hast thou
been unto me. I will not cease to regret thy
loss, till I meet thee in a better world.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“OUR hearts,” continued the old man, addressing
me, “are loosened from their attachment
to this world by repeated strokes of misfortune.
Wisely is it ordered thus. Every
calamity severs a string from the heart—until
one scene of sorrow on the back of another
matures us for eternity—Thus are our affections
estranged from this scene of misery.
The cord that detains the bird is severed in
two—and it flies away.</p>

<p class='c009'>“FORMERLY as I sat in this place—in
the mild shade of the evening—when I had
returned from my labour and took <em>Fidelia</em> on
my knee, how often have I rendered thanks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>to Heaven for the happiness I enjoyed, and
implored His power to make my child such
another as <em>Charlotte</em>—This sweet remembrance
yet swells and agitates my heart, and in
the midst of the distress which surrounds me, I
feel a consolation in tracing to you a feeble
sketch of the happy times that are passed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>THE old man was sensibly affected—he delighted
to dwell on what his child had been—he
thought of those times—and he sighed
when he contrasted them with the present.</p>

<p class='c009'>“IN her disordered state,” continued he,
“she knows me not as a father—I spread my
morsel before her, and she flies from it—she
forgets the sound of my voice—she is no
longer unto me as a daughter. She who hath
so often said, she would support me with her
arm, and lead me about, when I should be
old and decrepit—to her I call, but she returns
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>me no answer. Is not the cause of my
woes, a melancholy instance of the baleful art
of the SEDUCER?—She is deprived of her
reason, and knows not the weight of her
misery; and I am doubly deadened with her
affliction, and the accumulated misfortune of
immature decrepitude.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“SEDUCTION is a crime,” I observed,
“that nothing can be said to palliate or excuse.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“AND WOE to him,” added the old man,
“who shall endeavour to extenuate it—<em>They
have taken away my staff</em>”—continued he,
raising a look of imploring mercy to Heaven,
while a trembling tear rolled from his swollen
eye, “<em>They have taken away my staff in my old
age.</em>”</p>

<p class='c009'>FREELY did my heart share in the sorrows
of the good old man—when I left him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>I prayed Heaven to compassionate his distress—and
as I bent my pensive step towards
<em>Belleview</em>, I had leisure to animadvert on the
fatal tendency of SEDUCTION.</p>

<p class='c012'>I AM sometimes mortified to
find the books which I recommend to your
perusal, are not always applicable to the situation
of an <em>American</em> lady. The general
observations of some <em>English</em> books are the
most useful things contained in them; the
principal parts being chiefly filled with local
descriptions, which a young woman here is
frequently at a loss to understand.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1002'>1002</span>I SEND you a little work, entitled “<em>A lady
of Quality’s Advice to her Children</em>” which,
though not altogether free from this exception,
is highly worthy of your attention. A parent
who is represented struggling with the distress
of a lingering illness, bequeaths a system
of education to her offspring. I do not recommend
it to you as a Novel, but as a work
that speaks the language of the heart and
that inculcates the duty we owe to ourselves,
to society and the Deity.</p>

<p class='c009'>DIDACTICK essays are not always capable
of engaging the attention of young
ladies. We fly from the laboured precepts of
the essayist, to the sprightly narrative of the
novelist. Habituate your mind to remark the
difference between truth and fiction. You
will then always be enabled to judge of the
propriety and justness of a thought; and
never be misled to form wrong opinions, by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1003'>1003</span>the meretricious <em>dress</em> of a pleasing tale. You
will then be capable of deducing the most
profitable lessons of instruction, and the design
of your <em>reading</em> will be fully accomplished.—</p>

<p class='c009'>HENCE you will be provided with a key to
the characters of men: To unlock these curious
cabinets is a very useful, as well as
entertaining employment. Of those insidious
gentlemen, who plan their advances
towards us on the <em>Chesterfieldian</em> system, let
me advise you to beware. A prudent commander
would place a double watch, if he
apprehended the enemy were more disposed
to take the fort by secrecy and undermining,
than by an open assault.</p>

<p class='c009'>I CANNOT but smile sometimes, to observe
the ridiculous figure of some of our
young gentlemen, who affect to square their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1004'>1004</span>conduct by his <span class='sc'>Lordship’s</span> principles of
politeness—they never tell a story unless it
be very short—they talk of decorum and the
<em>etiquette</em>—they detest everything vulgar or
common—they are on the rack if an old man
should let fall a proverb—and a thousand
more trifling affectations, the ridicule of
which arises, not so much from their putting
on this foreign dress, as from their ignorance
or vanity in pretending to imitate those
rules which were designed for an English
nobleman—Unless, therefore, they have a
prospect of being called by Congress to execute
some foreign negotiation, they ought
certainly to be minding their business.</p>

<p class='c009'>THIS affectation of fine breeding is destructive
to morals. Dissimulation and insincerity
are connected with its tenets; and are
mutually inculcated with the art of pleasing.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1005'>1005</span>A PERSON of this character grounds his
motives for pleasing on the most selfish principle—He
is polite, not for the honour of
obliging you, as he endeavours to make you
believe, but that he himself might be obliged.
Suspect him, therefore, of insincerity and
treachery, who sacrifices truth to complaisance,
and advises you to the pursuit of an object,
which would tend to his advantage.</p>

<p class='c009'>ALWAYS distinguish the man of sense
from the cox-comb. Mr. <em>Worthy</em> is possessed
of a good understanding, and an exact judgement.
If you are united with him, let it be
the study of your life to preserve his love and
esteem. His amiable character is adorned
with modesty and a disposition to virtue and
sobriety. I never anticipate your future happiness,
but I contemplate this part of his
character with pleasure. But remember the
fidelity of a wife alone, will not always secure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1006'>1006</span>the esteem of a husband; when her personal
attractions do not continue to delight his eye,
she will flatter his judgement. I think you are
enabled to perform this, because you are solicitous
to supply your mind with those amiable
qualities which are more durable than beauty.
When you are no longer surrounded with a
flattering circle of young men, and the world
shall cease to call you beautiful, your company
will be courted by men of sense, who know
the value of your conversation.</p>

<p class='c009'>I AM pleased with the conduct of some
agreeable girls, and the return of civility and
attention they often make to the conceited
compliments of a certain class of beaux.
These ladies wisely consider them as the
butterflies of a day, and therefore generally
scorn <em>to break them on a wheel</em>!</p>

<p class='c009'>WHEN you are in company, when the vain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1007'>1007</span>and thoughtless endeavour to shew their ingenuity
by ridiculing particular orders of men,
your prudence will dictate to you not to countenance
their abuse—The book I have just
mentioned, intimates, that “there are a great
many things done and said in company which
a woman of virtue will neither see nor hear.”—To
discountenance levity, is a sure way to
guard against the encroachment of temptation;
to participate in the mirth of a buffoon,
is to render yourself equally ridiculous. We
owe to ourselves a <em>detestation</em> of folley, and to
the world, the appearance of it. I would have
you avoid coquetry and affectation, and the
observance of my maxims will never make
you a prude—Pretend, therefore, should a
vain youth throw out illiberal sarcasms against
Mechanicks, Lawyers, Ministers, Virtue, Religion,
or any serious subject, not to comprehend
the point of his wit.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1008'>1008</span>I HAVE seldom spoken to you on the importance
of Religion, and the veneration due
to the characters of the Clergy. I always supposed
your good sense capable of suggesting
their necessity and eligibility. The Ministers
of no nation are more remarkable for learning
and piety than those of this country. The
fool may pretend to scorn, and the irreligious
to contemn, but every person of sense and
reflection must admire that sacred order,
whose business is to inform the understanding,
and regulate the passions of mankind.
Surely, therefore, that class of men, will continue
to merit our esteem and affection, while
virtue remains upon earth.</p>

<p class='c009'>I AM always pleased with the reasonable
and amiable light in which the Clergy are
placed by the author of the <cite>Guardian</cite>—“The
light,” says he, “in which these points should
be exposed to the view of one who is prejudiced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1009'>1009</span>against the names, Religion, Church,
Priest, or the like, is to consider the Clergy as
so many Philosophers, the Churches as
Schools, and their Sermons as Lectures for
the improvement and information of the audience.
How would the heart of <em>Tully</em> or <em>Socrates</em>
have rejoiced, had they lived in a nation
where the law had made provision for philosophers
to read lectures of philosophy, every
seventh day, in several thousands of schools,
erected at the publick charge, throughout the
whole country, at which lectures, all ranks
and sexes, without distinction, were obliged
to be present, for their general improvement?”</p>

<p class='c009'>YOU may, perhaps, think this letter too
serious, but remember that virtue and religion
are the foundation of education.</p>

<p class='c012'>YOU will observe, my dear
friend, that most of the letters I have written
to you of late, on female education, are confined
to the subject of study. I am sensible
of the ridicule sometimes levelled at those
who are called learned ladies. Either these
ladies must be uncommonly pedantick, or
those who ridicule them, uncommonly ignorant—Do
not be apprehensive of acquiring
that title, or sharing the ridicule, but remember
that the knowledge which I wish you to
acquire, is necessary to adorn your many virtues
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1011'>1011</span>and amiable qualifications. This ridicule
is evidently a trans-Atlantick idea, and must
have been imbibed from the source of some
<em>English</em> Novel or Magazine—The <em>American</em>
ladies of this class, who come within our
knowledge, we know to be justly celebrated
as ornaments to society, and an honour to the
sex. When it is considered how many of our
countrywomen are capable of the task, it is
a matter of regret that <em>American</em> literature
boasts so few productions from the pens of the
ladies.</p>

<p class='c009'>SELF complacency is a most necessary
acquirement—for the value of a woman will
always be commensurate to the opinion she
entertains of herself. A celebrated European
wit, in a letter to a lady, concentres much
good advice in the short rule of conduct:
“<span class='sc'>Reverence Thyself</span>.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1012'>1012</span>I WAS this morning reading <em>Swift’s</em> letter
to a very young lady, on her marriage. Although
this famous writer is not celebrated
for delicacy or respect towards us, yet I wish
some of his observations contained less truth—If
you are in company, says this writer,
when the conversation turns on the manners
and customs of remote nations, or on books in
verse or prose, or on the nature and limits of
virtue and vice, it is a shame for a lady not to
relish such discourses, not to improve by
them, and endeavour by reading and information,
to have her share in those entertainments,
rather than turn aside, as is the usual
custom, and consult with the woman who sits
next her, about a new cargo of fans.</p>

<p class='c009'>HE then descends to particulars, and insists
on the necessity of orthography. Is it not a
little hard, continues he, that not one gentleman’s
daughter in a thousand should be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1013'>1013</span>brought to read or understand her own natural
tongue, or be judge of the easiest books
that are written in it; as any one may find,
who can have the patience to hear them mangle
a Play or a Novel?</p>

<p class='c009'>IF there be any of your acquaintance to
whom this passage is applicable, I hope you
will recommend the study of Mr. <em>Webster’s</em>
Grammatical Institute, as the best work in our
language to facilitate the knowledge of Grammar.
I cannot but think Mr. <em>Webster</em> intended
his valuable book for the benefit of his
countrywomen: For while he delivers his
<em>rules</em> in a pure, precise, and elegant style, he
<em>explains</em> his meaning by <em>examples</em> which are
calculated to inspire the female mind with a
thirst for emulation, and a desire of virtue.</p>

<p class='c009'>NO subject has been more exhausted than
that of education. Many <em>Utopian</em> schemes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1014'>1014</span>have been delineated, and much speculation
employed. When I peruse these labours, and
am persuaded the intention of their authors is
to promote our welfare, I feel myself prompted
to a prudent and amiable demeanour; and I
suppose every woman of reason and reflection
feels the same inclination to virtue, and the
same sensations of gratitude in reading the
works of those writers, the characteristicks of
whom, are sentiment, morality and benevolence.</p>

<p class='c009'>WHAT books do you read, my dear? We
are now finishing <em>Barlow’s</em> Vision of <em>Columbus</em>,
and shall begin upon <em>Dwight’s</em> Conquest
of <em>Canaan</em> in a few days. It is very agreeable
to read with one, who points out the beauties
of the author as we proceed. Such a one is
<em>Worthy</em>.—Sometimes Mr. <em>Holmes</em> makes one
of our party, and his notes and references to
the ancient poets are very entertaining.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1015'>1015</span><em>Worthy</em> is delighted with the ease and freedom
with which we live here. We have little
concerts, we walk, we ride, we read, we have
good company—this is <em>Belleview</em> in all its
glory.</p>

<p class='c009'>ADIEU, my dear—I shall continue this
subject no longer, though I flatter myself you
would receive my hints with satisfaction, because
you must be persuaded I love you, and
so interest myself in your welfare—I need
not add that I think your conduct worthy of
you. You are such a good girl that I know
not in what to direct you; for you leave me
no room for advice—continue to anticipate
the desires of my heart, and secure the high
opinion you have there obtained.</p>

<p class='c012'>I HAVE just left <em>Harriot</em>—but
how have I left her? In tears. I wish I had
not gone. Mrs. <em>Francis</em> had intrusted <em>Harriot</em>
with some trifling commission—It was
not done—she had not had time to perform
it. <em>Harriot</em> was reprimanded—Yes! by
Heaven—this Mrs. <em>Francis</em> had the insolence
to reprimand <em>Harriot</em> in my presence—I was
mortified—I walked to the window—my
heart was on fire—my blood boiled in my
veins—it is impossible to form an idea of the
disorder of my nerves—<em>Harriot’s</em> were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1027'>1027</span>equally agitated—Mrs. <em>Francis</em> saw our confusion
and retired—she left me so completely
out of temper that I was forced to follow her
example. I kissed away the tear from the
cheek of <em>Harriot</em> and withdrew to my
chamber.</p>

<p class='c009'>HERE let me forget what has passed—my
irritability will not permit me—my feelings
are too easily set in motion to enjoy long
quietness—my nerves are delicately strung;
they are now out of tune, and it is a hard
matter to harmonize them.</p>

<p class='c009'>I FEEL <em>that I have a soul</em>—and every man
of sensibility feels it within himself. I will relate
a circumstance I met with in my late
travels through <em>Southcarolina</em>—I was always
susceptible of <em>touches of nature</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>I HAD often remarked a female slave pass
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1028'>1028</span>by my window to a spring to fetch water.
She had something in her air superior to
those of her situation—a fire that the damps
of slavery had not extinguished.</p>

<p class='c009'>AS I was one day walking behind her, the
wind blew her tattered handkerchief from her
neck and exposed it to my sight. I asked
her the cause of the scar on her shoulder.
She answered composedly, and with an earnestness
that proved she was not ashamed to
declare it—“It is the mark of the whip,”
said she, and went on with the history of it,
without my desiring her to proceed—“My
boy, of about ten years old, was unlucky
enough to break a glass tumbler—this crime
was immediately looked into—I trembled for
the fate of my child, and was thought to be
guilty. I did not deny the charge, and was
tied up. My former good character availed
nothing. Under every affliction, we may receive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1029'>1029</span>consolation; and during the smart of
the whip, I rejoiced—because I shielded with
my body the lash from my child; and I rendered
thanks to the Best of Beings that I was
allowed to suffer for him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“HEROICALLY spoken!” said I, “may
He whom you call the Best of Beings continue
you in the same sentiments—may thy soul
be ever disposed to <span class='fss'>SYMPATHIZE</span> with thy
children, and with thy brethren and sisters in
calamity—then shalt thou feel every circumstance
of thy life afford the satisfaction; and
repining and melancholy shall fly from thy
bosom—all thy labours will become easy—all
thy burdens light, and the yoke of slavery
will never gall thy neck.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I WAS sensibly relieved as I pronounced
these words, and I felt my heart glow with
feelings of exquisite delight, as I anticipated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1030'>1030</span>the happy time when the sighs of the slave
shall no longer expire in the air of freedom.
What delightful sensations are those in which
the heart is interested! In which it stoops to
enter into the little concerns of the most remote
ramification of Nature! Let the vain,
the giddy, and the proud pass on without
deigning to notice them—let them cheat
themselves of happiness—these are circumstances
which are important only to a sentimental
traveller.</p>

<p class='c009'>HAIL <em>sensibility</em>! Sweetener of the joys
of life! Heaven has implanted thee in the
breasts of his children—to soothe the sorrows
of the afflicted—to mitigate the wounds
of the stranger who falleth in our way. <em>Thou</em>
regardest with an eye of pity, those whom

  <h2 class='c007'>LETTER XXXIX.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. <em>Holmes</em> to <em>Myra</em>.</p>
<div class='c013'><em>Belleview.</em></div>

<p class='c012'>I READILY undertake to give
you a sketch of the history of <em>Harriot</em>. Her
mother’s name was <em>Maria Fawcet</em>; her person
I yet recollect, and forgive me if I drop a
tear of pity at the recital of her misfortunes.</p>

<p class='c009'>MY mother and Mrs. <em>Holmes</em> were remarkable
friends, and the intimacy, you know, was
maintained between the two families. I was
on a visit with my mother when the destiny
of <em>Maria</em> led her to <em>Belleview</em>. I was frequently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1037'>1037</span>there during her illness—and was
with her in her last moments.</p>

<p class='c009'>IT was the custom of Mrs. <em>Holmes</em> to walk
in the garden towards the close of the day.
She was once indulging her usual walk, when
she was alarmed by the complaints of a
woman which came from the road. Pity and
humanity were ever peculiar characteristicks
of my amiable parent—She hastened to the
place whence the sound issued, and beheld a
young woman, bathed in tears sitting on the
ground. She inquired the cause of her distress,
with that eager solicitude to relieve,
which a sight so uncommon would naturally
occasion. It was sometime before the distressed
woman could return an intelligible
answer, and then she with difficulty proceeded:
“Your goodness, Madam, is unmerited—you
behold a stranger, without home—without
friends—and whose misery bears
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1038'>1038</span>her down to an untimely grave—Life is a
blessing—but my life is become burthensome,
and were the Almighty this moment to
command me to the world of spirits, methinks
I could gladly obey the summons, and rejoice
in the stroke which bade me depart from sorrow
and the world.” Moderate your grief,
my dear woman, repine not at the will of
Providence, nor suffer yourself to despair,
however severe your misfortunes.</p>

<p class='c009'>THE unfortunate woman was at length
prevailed on to accompany Mrs. <em>Holmes</em> into
the house, she partook of some refreshment
and retired to sleep. In a few days she
appeared to be better; but it was a temporary
recovery; she then told her story,
with frequent interruptions, in substance as
follows:—</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_1039'>1039</span>
  <h3 class='c018'><span class='fixed'>History of Maria.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c019'>“I DATE the rise of my misfortunes,”
said <em>Maria</em>, “at the beginning of my
acquaintance with the Honourable Mr. <em>Harrington</em>.—But
for his solicitations I might
still have lived in peace—a sister would not
have had occasion to blush at the sound of my
name—nor had a mother’s pillow been
steeped in tears, too fondly prone to remember
a graceless but repenting child—We
lived happily together in the days of my
father, but when it pleased Providence to remove
him, we no longer asserted our pretensions
to that rank of life which our straitened
finances were unable to continue.—A young
woman in no eligible circumstances, has much
to apprehend from the solicitations of a man
of affluence. I am now better persuaded of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1040'>1040</span>this truth, than I ever was before—for this
was my unhappy situation—I always entertained
a predilection for Mr. <em>Harrington</em>—he
urged his passion with protestations of
sincerity and affection—he found my heart
too slightly guarded—he strove—he triumphed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“——MUST I proceed!</p>

<p class='c009'>“A SMILING female was the offspring
of our illicit connexion—Ah! my little <em>Harriot</em>!”
continued <em>Maria</em>, as she wiped away a
tear from her eye, “mayest thou enjoy that
happiness which is denied to thy mother.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“OUR amour was not fated to last long—I
discovered his gay temper to be materially
altered—he was oftentimes thoughtful and
melancholy, and his visits became suddenly
shorter, and less frequent.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1041'>1041</span>“I AFTERWARDS thought this change
of conduct owing to jealousy—for he once
asked me if a gentleman had called upon me—I
persisted—I persisted in avowing my
abhorrence of his ungenerous suspicion—He
left me abruptly, and I saw nothing of him
after.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A STROKE so unexpected fell heavy on
my heart—it awakened me to the state of
misery into which my imprudence had hurried
me.—What recompense could I expect from
my Seducer?—He had been married two
years—From the inflexibility of his temper I
had little to hope, and I formed a determination
of leaving town, for I had now indubitable
testimony of his affection being estranged
from me—half frantick, I immediately
set out—but whither I knew not—I
walked with precipitation until Providence
directed me to your hospitable door: To
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1042'>1042</span>your goodness, Madam, I am indebted for prolonging
my existence a <em>few</em> days: For amidst
the kindness and civilities of those around me,
I feel myself rapidly verging towards the
grave. I prepare myself for my approaching
fate—and daily wait the stroke of death with
trembling expectation.”</p>

<p class='c009'>SHE wrote to Mr. <em>Harrington</em> about a
week before her decease—I transcribe the
Letter:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<em>The Hon. Mr. Harrington.</em></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“To the man for whom my bleeding
heart yet retains its wonted affection, though
the author of my guilt and misery, do I address
my feeble complaint—O! <em>Harrington</em>,
I am verging to a long eternity—and it is
with difficulty I support myself while my
trembling hand traces the dictates of my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1043'>1043</span>heart. Indisposed as I am—and unable as I
feel to prosecute this talk—I however collect
all my powers to bid you a long—a final farewel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“OH! <em>Harrington</em>, I am about to depart—for
why should I tarry here? In bitter
tears of sorrow do I weep away the night,
and the returning day but augments the anguish
of my heart, by recalling to view the sad
sight of my misfortunes. And have I not
cause for this severe anguish, at once sorrow
and disgrace of my family?—Alas! my poor
mother!—Death shall expiate the crime of
thy daughter, nor longer raise the blush of
indignation on thy glowing cheek.—Ought
I not, therefore, to welcome the hand of
death?</p>

<p class='c009'>“But what will become of my poor helpless
infant, when its mother lies forgotten in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1044'>1044</span>grave? Wilt thou direct its feet in the path
of virtue and rectitude? Wilt thou shelter it
from the rude blasts of penury and want?—Open
your heart to the solicitude of a mother—of
a mother agonizing for the future welfare
of her child. Let me intreat you to perform
this request—by the love which you
professed for thy <em>Maria</em>—by her life which
you have sacrificed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“AND wilt thou not drop a tear of pity in
the grave of thy <em>Maria</em>?—I know thy soul
is the soul of sensibility; but my departure
shall not grieve thee—no, my <em>Harrington</em>,
it shall not wrest a sigh from thy bosom—rather
let me live, and defy the malice and
misery of the world—But can tenderness—can
love atone for the sacrifices I have made?—Will
it blot out my errours from the book
of memory? Will love be an excuse for my
crime, or hide me from the eye of the malignant—No,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1045'>1045</span>my <em>Harrington</em>, it will not. The
passion is unwarrantable. Be it thine, gentle
<em>Amelia</em>—be it thine to check the obtruding
sigh, and wipe away the tear from his face—for
thou art his wife, and thy soul is the seat
of compassion—But—for me—</p>

      <div class='line in20'>MARIA.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>SHE survived but a short time—and
frequently expressed a concern for the
child—but Mrs. <em>Holmes</em> quieted her fears by
promising to protect it. She accordingly
made inquiry after it—and it is the same
<em>Harriot</em> who was educated by her order, and
whom she afterwards placed in the family of
Mrs. <em>Francis</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>The assurances of my mother were like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1046'>1046</span>balm to the broken hearted <em>Maria</em>—“I shall
now,” said she, “die in peace.”</p>

<p class='c009'>THE following is a copy of a letter written
by the Rev. Mr. <em>Holmes</em> to the Hon. Mr.
<em>Harrington</em>:—</p>

<div class='c020'><em>Belleview.</em></div>

<p class='c009'>“SIR,</p>

<p class='c012'>“WE have a scene of distress at
our house peculiarly pathetick and affecting,
and of which you, perhaps, are the sole author—You
have had a criminal connexion
with Miss <em>Fawcet</em>—you have turned her
upon the world inhumanly—but chance—rather
let me say Providence, hath directed
her footsteps to my dwelling, where she is
kindly entertained, and will be so, as long as
she remains in this wilderness world, which is
to be, I fear, but a short time—And shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1047'>1047</span>she not, though she hath been decoyed from
the road that leadeth to peace, long life, and
happiness—shall she not, if she return with
tears of repentance and contrition, be entitled
to our love and charity? Yes—this is my
doctrine—If I behold any child of human
nature distressed and forlorn, and in real want
of the necessities of life, must I restrain or
withhold the hand of charity—must I cease
to recall the departing spirit of them that are
ready to perish, until I make diligent inquiry
into their circumstances and character?
Surely, my friend, it is a duty incumbent on
us by the ties of humanity and fellow-feeling,
and by the duty imposed on us by our holy
religion, equally to extend the hand of relief
to <em>all the necessitous</em>—however they may be
circumstanced in the great family of mankind.</p>

<p class='c009'>“THE crime of <em>Maria</em> is not the blackest
in the annals of human turpitude; but however
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1048'>1048</span>guilty she might have been, the tears of
penitence do certainly make atonement therefor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“THUS much have I thought proper to
say in vindication of my conduct—in sheltering
under my roof a poor wanderer—who
hath strayed, but not wantonly, and who hath
now happily returned.</p>

<p class='c009'>“ONE would imagine, there was little necessity
of making such a vindication to you;
but my sentiments always flow from the
abundance of my heart, and I am willing the
whole world should judge of those which influence
my conduct.—Now, though some
men, whose charity is contracted, and who
may be denominated <em>prudes in virtue</em>, might
deem wrongfully of my attention to the calamity
of this frail woman yet let me appeal
to the hearts and understandings of all men,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1049'>1049</span>and these in particular, if I have erred,
whether it be not an errour on the side of
humanity. Would to God such amiable
errours were more frequent!—In as much,
my friend, as there is joy in Heaven over one
sinner that repenteth, I may say with assurance
that I have felt an emanation of this
heavenly joy animate my heart, in beholding
this woman delighting to steer her course
heavenward.</p>

<p class='c009'>“FROM the unhappy condition of <em>Maria</em>,
I have been led to reflect on the mischievous
tendency of SEDUCTION. Methinks I
view the distressing picture in all its horrid
colours:—</p>

<p class='c009'>“BEHOLD the youthful virgin arrayed in
all the delightful charms of vivacity, modesty
and sprightliness.—Behold even while she is
rising in beauty and dignity, like a lily of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1050'>1050</span>valley, in the full blossom of her graces, she
is cut off suddenly by the rude hand of the
Seducer. Unacquainted with his baseness
and treachery, and too ready to repose confidence
in him—she is deluded by the promises
and flattery of the man who professes
the greatest love and tenderness for her welfare:—</p>

<p class='c009'>“BUT did she understand the secret villainy
of his intentions—would she appear
thus elate and joyous? Would she assent to
her ruin? Would she subscribe her name to
the catalogue of infamy? Would she kiss
the hand of the atrocious dastard, already
raised to give the final wound to her reputation
and peace?</p>

<p class='c009'>“O! WHY is there not an adequate punishment
for this crime, when that of a common
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1051'>1051</span>traitor is marked with its deserved iniquity
and abhorrence!</p>

<p class='c009'>“IS it necessary to depicture the state of
this deluded young creature after her fall
from virtue? Stung with remorse, and frantick
with despair, does she not fly from the
face of day, and secrete her conscious head in
the bosom of eternal forgetfulness? Melancholy
and guilt transfix her heart, and she
sighs out her miserable existence—the prey
of poverty, ignominy and reproach! Lost
to the world, to her friends, and to herself,
she blesses the approach of death in whatever
shape he may appear, and terminates a life,
no longer a blessing to its possessor, or a joy
to those around her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“BEHOLD her stretched upon the mournful
bier!—Behold her silently descend to the
grave! Soon the wild weeds spring afresh
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1052'>1052</span>round the <em>little hillock</em>, as if to shelter the
remains of betrayed innocence—and the
friends of her youth shun even the spot which
conceals her relicks.</p>

<p class='c009'>“SUCH is the consequence of SEDUCTION,
but it is not the only consequence.
Peace and happiness fly from the nuptial
couch which is unattended by love and fidelity.
The mind no longer enjoys its quiet, while it
ceases to cherish sentiments of truth and
gratitude. The sacred <em>ties</em> of connubial duty
are not to be violated with impunity; for
though a violation of those <em>ties</em> may be overlooked
by the eye of justice, the heart shall
supply a <em>monitor</em>, who will not fail to correct
those who are hardy enough to burst them
asunder.——I am &amp;c.</p>

    <div><em>Hon. Mr.</em> <span class='sc'>Harrington</span> to the <em>Rev. Mr.</em> <span class='sc'>Holmes</span>.</div>

</div>

<p class='c009'>“PERMIT me, my ever honoured friend,
to return you thanks for your late favours—need
I add—an acknowledgement for your
liberality? No—your heart supplies a source
of pleasure which is constantly nourished by
your goodness and universal charity.—</p>

<p class='c009'>“THE picture you have exhibited of a
ruined female is undoubtedly just, but that
the <em>rude spoiler</em> has his share of remorse is
equally so—The conclusion of your letter is
a real picture of the situation of my heart.</p>

<p class='c009'>“PERHAPS you were always ignorant of
the real motives that influenced me, and gave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1054'>1054</span>a particular bias to my conduct.—At an
early period of my life, I adopted a maxim,
that <em>the most necessary learning was a knowledge
of the world</em>, the pursuit of which, quadrating
with a volatility of disposition, presented
a variety of scenes to my heated imagination.
The <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclat</span></i> of my companions gratifying
my vanity and increasing the gale of
passion, I became insensibly hurried down
the stream of dissipation. Here I saw mankind
in every point of view—from the acme
of the most consummate refinement, to the
most abject stage of degradation. I soon became
a ready proficient in the great school of
the world—but an alteration of conduct was
soon after necessary—I was compelled to it,
not so much from the world’s abhorrence of a
dissolute course of life, as the dictates of my
own heart.—It was, indeed, my policy to
flatter the world, and exhibit a fair outside—for
I was in love with <em>Amelia</em>—My licentious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1055'>1055</span>amour with <em>Maria</em> was secret—she was
affectionate and tender—her manners were
pleasing, but still I was unhappy.—</p>

<p class='c009'>“MY CAREER of dissipation, however
alluring it struck my vitiated fancy, left little
satisfaction on the mind—Reflection had its
turn—and the happiness I had promised myself
in connexion with the amiable <em>Amelia</em>,
I fully enjoyed in our marriage. A course of
uninterrupted tranquillity ensued, but it was
of short duration. The volatility of my
temper, and the solicitude of my old associates,
induced me at subsequent periods to fall
into my old vagaries. The taverns frequently
found me engaged in meannesses derogatory
to the character of a gentleman. These
things I perceived affected the soul of <em>Amelia</em>—she
was all meekness, gentleness and compassion,
and she never once upbraided me
with my illiberal conduct;</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1056'>1056</span>But let concealment, like a worm in bud,</div>
      <div class='line'>Feed on her damask cheek.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“BLESSED be that Power who has implanted
within us that consciousness of reproach,
which springs from gentleness and
love!—Hail sensibility! Ye eloquent <em>tears</em>
of <em>beauty</em>! that add dignity to human nature
by correcting its foibles—it was <em>these</em> that
corrected my faults when recrimination
would have failed of success—it was <em>these</em>
that opened every avenue of contrition in my
heart, when <em>words</em> would have damned up
every sluice of repentance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“IT was now I appeared fully sensible
that my conduct had hitherto been a course
of disorder, and that systems of reformation,
however well planned, had been overturned
by the breath of adulation, before they had
been thoroughly carried into execution—that
I had been drifting upon a sea of inconsistency,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1057'>1057</span>without exercising my judgement;
like a ship without a rudder, buffeted on the
bosom of the ocean, the sport of winds and
waves.</p>

<p class='c009'>“THE criminality of my connexion with
<em>Maria</em> appeared with the most aggravated
circumstances; it stung me with remorse—and
I instantly determined, however severe
the conflict, to tear her from my bosom—to
see her no more.—But how was I to inform
her of it?—In what manner was I to bring
about such a talk?—<em>Maria</em> must be sacrificed
to the happiness of <em>Amelia</em>. This was all I
had to perform—it was a short lesson, but
it was a hard one for me to execute.</p>

<p class='c009'>“WITH this determination, however, I
entered the apartment of <em>Maria</em>—Duty to
<em>Amelia</em> and gratitude to <em>Maria</em> interchangeably
agitated me—the contention was dubious—but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1058'>1058</span>duty prevailed, and I adhered to
my former resolution—yet how was I to tell
her <em>this would be the last visit</em>?—Conscious
she had ever acted in conformity to my
wishes—how could I accuse her, without
accusing myself?—I threw out a few inconsiderate
and ungrateful hints of jealousy, and
left the room abruptly. The feelings of
<em>Maria</em> must have been injured—but however
her sensibility was affected, mine was
doubly so; I felt for her—I felt for our infant,
and these feelings were added to the
afflictions which had already burst upon my
devoted head. A few days consideration,
however, convinced me of the impropriety
and ingratitude of my behaviour to <em>Maria</em>—I
hastened to tell her of it—to place her in a
situation that should screen her from penury
and malice—and to make provision for the
child—but she was not to be found. I was
informed that she had suddenly disappeared,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1059'>1059</span>and that a countryman had, by her order,
called and taken away the child but a few
hours before. This information burst upon
my head like the voice of sudden thunder—I
stood motionless, but my agitation was too
violent to be of any long duration.—</p>

past life, I daily learn some new lesson of
humanity. Experience hath been my tutor—I
now take a retrospect of my past conduct
with deliberation, but not without some serious
reflection. Like a sailor, escaped from

heads in the bosom of the deep, he beholds
with greater concern the mischief of the
storm, and the dangers he hath escaped.
From what innate principle does this arise,
but from <em>God within the mind</em>!—I assert it
for the honour of human nature, that no man,
however dissolute, but comes back to the
hour of reflection and solemn thoughtfulness—when
the actions that are passed return
upon the mind, and this <em>internal monitor</em> sits
in judgment upon them, and gives her verdict
of approbation or dislike.</p>

<p class='c009'>“HE who listens to its call, views his character
in its proper light.—I have attended to
its cry, and I see my deformity—I recall my
misspent time, but in vain—I reflect on the
misery of <em>Maria</em>, and I curse my temerity—I
reflect on the state into which I have
plunged a once happy female, and am eager
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1061'>1061</span>to apply a speedy remedy, but this is vain
also: Can I restore her that virtue—that
innocence—that peace, of which I have unmanfully
robbed her?—Let us leave the melancholy
subject.—</p>

<p class='c009'>“I WILL not so far supercede the fruit of
your benevolence, as to presume to offer you
any other recompense, than my sincere prayers
for your happiness.</p>

<p class='c009'>THE disorder of <em>Maria</em> was fatal
and rapid—but I hasten to the last scene of
her life—it has, though I was young, made
an impression on my mind that time can not
efface. I went to her, as she was seated on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1062'>1062</span>the bed—virtue and harmony were blended
in her aspect—she was serene and composed—and
her mein, while it expressed a consciousness
of superior worth and dignity, exhibited
in our view, a striking picture of the
grandeur of the human soul—patient though
afflicted—of a spirit broken, and borne down
by severe distress, yet striving to surmount
all, and aspire to heaven. In what words
shall I paint to you, my dear <em>Myra</em>, her heroism
and greatness of mind? “Weep not for
me,” said she, perceiving my emotion—“Death
has nothing shocking to me—I have
familiarized myself to his terrours—I feel the
gradual decay of mortality; and waiting with
confidence in the Father of Mercy, I am prepared
to resign this mortal breath—I resign it
in firm assurance of the soul’s blessed immortality—Death
I view as freeing me from a
world which has lost its relish—as opening
new scenes of happiness—But a few moments,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1063'>1063</span>continued she, clasping my hand,
“and the scene of life is closed forever—Heaven
opens on my soul—I go where all
tears shall be wiped away—I welcome death
as the angel of peace.”—She uttered these
words with a placid smile of resignation—her
head sunk down on the pillow—and the
next minute she was an angel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“SOUL of the universe!” exclaimed my
father-in-law—“there flew the gentlest spirit
that ever animated human dust—Great were
thy temptations—sincere thy repentance.
If some human infirmity fell to thy lot, thy
tears, dear shade, have washed out thy guilt
forever!”</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>LETTER XL.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. <em>Holmes</em> to <em>Myra</em>.</p>
<div class='c013'><em>Belleview.</em></div>

<p class='c012'>HAVING presented you with
several observations on Seduction, I think it
will not be <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">mal apropos</span></i> to consider the question
in another point of view, and discover
how a woman may be <em>accessary</em> to her own
ruin—It is hardly worth while to contend
about the difference between the meaning of
the terms <em>accessary</em> and <em>principal</em>. The difference,
in fact, is small; but when a woman, by
her imprudence, exposes herself, she is <em>accessary</em>;
for though her heart may be pure, her
conduct is a tacit invitation to the Seducer.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1065'>1065</span>EDUCATED in the school of luxury and
pride, the female heart grows gradually torpid
to the fine feelings of sensibility—the blush
of modesty wears off—the charms of elegant
simplicity fade by degrees—and the continual
hurry of dissipation, supersedes the improvement
of serious reflection. Reflection is a
kind of relaxation from frolicking—it encourages
the progress of virtue, and upholds the
heart from sinking to depravity.</p>

<p class='c009'>WE may lay it down as a principle, that
<em>that conduct which</em> will bear the test of reflection,
and which creates a pleasure in the mind
from a consciousness of acting right, is virtuous:
And she whose conduct will not bear
this test, is necessarily degenerating, and she
is assenting to her destruction.</p>

<p class='c009'>LET a lady be liberal or even magnificent,
according to her circumstances or situation in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1066'>1066</span>life; but let the heart remain uncorrupt, let
her not be contaminated by wealth, ambition
or splendour. She may then take a happy
retrospect of her conduct—her heart cannot
upbraid her—and the suffrage of her own
mind is a convincing proof that she has not
strayed from the path of virtue.</p>

<p class='c009'>HAPPY they who can thus reflect—who
can recall to view the scenes that are past,
and behold their actions with reiterated satisfaction—they
become ambitious of excelling
in everything virtuous, because they are certain
of securing a continual reward; For as a
mighty river fertilizes the country through
which it passes and increases in magnitude
and force until it empty itself into the ocean:
So virtue fertilizes or improves the heart, and
gathers strength and vigour by continual progression,
until it centre in the consummation
of its desires.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1067'>1067</span>DAZZLED by the glitter of splendour,
and unmindful of the real charms of economy
and simplicity, the female heart sighs for the
enjoyment of fashion, and flutters to join the
motley train of pleasure. But how is it deluded
by empty deceptions! Like the fruit
which sprang up in the infernal regions, beautiful
to the eye, but which left upon the taste
bitter ashes, and was followed by repentance—A
great quantity of this kind of fruit presents
itself to my rashly judging sex; and it
frequently happens that their hearts have as
little inclination to resist the temptation, as
our general parent to refuse the fatal apple.</p>

<p class='c009'>WE do not rouse to our aid fortitude to
enable us to surmount the temptation, but
yield ourselves to a kind of voluntary slavery.
Hence it is observable, that a woman is often
unhappy in the midst of pleasures—and petulant
without cause—that she is trifling in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1068'>1068</span>matters of the highest importance; and the
most momentous concern is considered futile,
as whim and caprice may chance to dictate.</p>

<p class='c009'>THE progress of female luxury, however
slow it may appear, unless timely checked,
works with infallible and destructive advances.
The rule we at first adopted might perhaps
answer this check; for by the examination
thus recommended we behold the dangers
of a continuation of such conduct—Ruin and
contempt, the invariable concomitants of
vice and immorality, proclaim their denunciations
on a prosecution of it.</p>

<p class='c009'>LET us examine the gradual steps, and the
consequences of female luxury.—A desire to
be admired is the first. Behold a woman
surrounded by her worshippers, receiving the
sacrifice of adulation—what was given her at
first as compliment, she now demands as her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1069'>1069</span>due. She finds herself disappointed, and is
mortified. The first desire still predominating,
she attaches herself to the votaries of
pride, who direct their feet in the paths of
extravagance and irreligion. Thus sunk into
effeminacy and meanness, <em>she forfeits her virtue
rather than her pride</em>. Thus terminates
the career of a woman, whose mind is debilitated,
and whose life is expended in the pursuit
of vanity.</p>

<p class='c009'>IT is said of some species of <em>American</em> serpents,
that they have the power of charming
birds and small animals, which they destine
for their prey. The serpent is stretched underneath
a tree—it looks steadfastly on the
bird—their eyes meet to separate no more—the
charm begins to operate—the fascinated
bird flutters and hops from limb to limb, till
unable any longer to extend its wings, it falls
into the voracious jaws of its enemy: This is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1070'>1070</span>no ill emblem of the fascinating power of
pleasure. Surrounded with temptation, and
embarrassed in her circumstances, a woman of
dissipation becomes less tenacious of her honour—and
falls an easy prey to the fascinating
power of the <em>seducer</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>HAVING traced to you, my dear <em>Myra</em>,
the rise, advancement and termination of
pleasure and pride in the female heart, it
appears almost unnecessary to remark that
this conduct cannot bear the test of reflection
and serious examination. We may, however,
observe on the contrary, that a woman who
advances a few steps, often hurries on still
further to prevent thought. This bars the
way to a return to that conduct which can
give pleasure on recollection. She behaves to
herself as the populace did formerly to women
suspected of witchcraft—they were tied neck
and heels and thrown into the river; if they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1071'>1071</span>swam they were hung for witches—if they
sank they were acquitted of the crime, but
were drowned in the experiment: So when
we only suspect our hearts of an errour, we
plunge still deeper into the sea of dissipation,
to prevent the trial of that conduct which
impartial reason and judgement would approve.</p>

<p class='c009'>NOTWITHSTANDING I give this instance
of an encouragement for virtue; yet in
all those I have mentioned is a woman <em>accessary</em>
to her ruin.</p>

<p class='c009'>DO not imagine, my dear <em>Myra</em>, that I
mean to argue against all pleasure—Many
of us set out on a principle of false delicacy
and destructive rivalship; we cannot behold
a fine woman without wishing to appear
finer. A laudable emulation in the conduct
of all women is extremely praiseworthy—it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1072'>1072</span>stimulates them in line of their duty—increases
vivacity and good humour; and ambition,
thus directed and pursued, I beg leave
to designate a female virtue, because it is productive
of the most happy consequences.</p>

<p class='c009'>BUT it sometimes happens that particular
virtues lose themselves in their neighbouring
vices, and this laudable emulation degenerates
into destructive rivalship.</p>

<p class='c009'>A GENTEEL, handsome woman, deservedly
shares the esteem and admiration of all
men; but why should this esteem and admiration,
justly paid to merit, give us disquiet?
The answer is ready. That desire to be admired
so predominant in all females, by degrees
works itself into the ruling passion, and
precludes from the mind the particular virtue
of emulation; for why a woman who merits
the love of the world, should draw on her the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1073'>1073</span>disapprobation of many of her own sex, can
be accounted for, by no other principle, than
the mean, pitiful passion of envy.</p>

<p class='c009'>THIS may possibly give rise to defamation.
It is astonishing how this practice prevails
among a <em>few</em> persons—because it is known
by experience, to prove subversive of its very
intention.—The arrows of envy recoil upon
herself.</p>

<p class='c009'>HOW foolish must that woman appear
who depreciates the merit of another, that
she may appear unrivalled! She raises up
the dykes of ill-nature, and inundates the
land with a flood of scandal, but unhappily
drowns herself in the event.</p>

<p class='c009'>I LEAVE it to the result of your observation,
my dear <em>Myra</em>, whether the woman who
is first to develope her stores of defamation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1074'>1074</span>and through false emulation, the first to traduce
a woman of real merit and virtue, is not
also the first who becomes a scandal to herself,
and consequently the first that is condemned.</p>

<p class='c009'>HOW opposite are the pursuits and rewards
of her who participates in every rational
enjoyment of life, without mixing in
those scenes of indiscretion which give pain
on recollection!—Whose chymical genius
leads her to extract the poison from the most
luxuriant flowers, and to draw honey even
from the weeds of society. She mixes with
the world seemingly indiscriminately—and
because she would secure to herself that satisfaction
which arises from a consciousness of
acting right, she views her conduct with an
eye of scrutiny. Though her temper is free
and unrestrained, her heart is previously secured
by the precepts of prudence—for prudence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1075'>1075</span>is but another name for virtue. Her
manners are unruffled, and her disposition
calm, temperate and dispassionate, however
she may be surrounded by the temptations of
the world.</p>

<p class='c012'>ACCUMULATED sorrows continue
to break over my devoted head. <em>Harriot</em>
is at times deprived of her reason, and
we have no expectation of her recovery—my
son is deeply affected—he seems strangely
disordered.</p>

<p class='c009'>REVOLVING in my mind all these things
and the unhappy affair that led to them, the
whole train of my past life returned fresh
upon my mind. Pained with the disagreeable
picture, and oppressed with the weight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1092'>1092</span>of my affliction, I sunk down to sleep: These
circumstances had so strongly impressed my
imagination that they produced the following
Dream—My blood is chilled with horrour as
I write.</p>

<p class='c009'>METHOUGHT I suddenly found myself
in a large, open field, waste and uncultivated—here
I wandered in a solitary manner for
some time—grief seized my heart at the awful
appearance of the place, and I cried aloud—“How
long shall I travel here, alone and
friendless—a dusky mist swims before my
sight, and the obscure horizon seems only to
inclose this dismal wild!” Having advanced
a few steps, I thought a light at a distance
appeared to my doubtful view. Faint
with fatigue, I approached it, and had the satisfaction
to behold a person of the most benign
aspect—a quiet serenity was painted
on his brow, happiness ineffable beamed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1093'>1093</span>from his Divine countenance—Joy leaped in
my bosom, and in the ecstasy of passion I endeavoured
to clasp the blessed spirit to my
heart; but it vanished in my embrace.</p>

<p class='c009'>“TEACH me, blessed shade,” said I, with
a trembling voice—“Teach me to find the
habitations of men—What do I here?—Why
am I doomed to explore the barren bosom of
this baleful desert?” “This,” returned the
spirit, in a voice, which, while it commanded
veneration and love, struck awe and terrour
into my soul—“<em>This</em> is not the habitation of
the sons of mortality—it is the place appointed
to receive the souls of all men, after
they have resigned the bodies they animated
on earth. Those who have violated the laws
of reason, humanity, religion, and have dishonoured
their God, here meet the punishment
due to their crimes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“ATTEND me, therefore, and view the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1094'>1094</span>condition of those thoughtless souls, who, a
few days ago, were upon earth immersed in
pleasure, luxury and vice—Regardless of
futurity, and unprepared for their eternal
summons to another world—and who persisted
in the delight of their own eyes in opposition
to the Divine law, and deaf to the
voice of reclaiming virtue. These, the sons
of folly and riot, are smitten by the angel of
death, while they are yet drinking of the
bowl of vice—while the words of blasphemy
yet dwell upon their tongues. And when
their unhappy spirits sink to these infernal
regions, their surviving companions rehearse
their funeral panegyricks—the praise of one
is, that he could drink the longest—the
merit of another that he could sing a good
song—a third secures his fame by being excellent
in mimickry and buffoonery.—How
unhappy he must be, who leaves no other
testimony of his usefulness behind him!</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1095'>1095</span>“HOW different is the fate of the good
man: While upon earth his life is employed
in the cause of virtue.—The happiness he
bestows on those around him is reflected back
with ten-fold reward; and when he takes rank
in that happy place, where there is fullness of
joy, and leaves the world of mankind, what
numbers are joined in the general concern of
his loss!—The aged, while they prepare for
the same journey, delight to dwell on his
good actions—the virgin strews flowers on
his grave, and the poet consumes the midnight
oil to celebrate his virtues.”</p>

<p class='c009'>THERE was so much benignity in every
word and action of my attendant, that I found
myself imperceptibly attached to him. My
attention to his discourse had prevented me
from observing the progress we had made—for
we had arrived at a place encircled with
high walls—A great gate, at the command of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1096'>1096</span>my guide, instantly flew open—“Follow
me,” said he—I tremblingly obeyed.</p>

<p class='c009'>MY ears were instantaneously filled with
the faint cries of those here doomed to receive
the rewards of their demerits. Looking
earnestly forward, I beheld a group of unhappy
wretches—I observed a person who
was continually tormenting them—he held
in one hand a whip, the lashes of which were
composed of adders, and the stings of scorpions;
and in the other a large mirrour, which,
when he held up to the faces of the tormented
exhibited their crimes in the most flagrant
colours, and forced them to acknowledge the
justness of their punishment. “These,” said
my guide, “who are scourged with a whip of
scorpions, and who start with horrour at the
reflection of their deeds upon earth, are the
souls of the Gambler—the Prodigal—the
Duellist, and the Ingrate.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1097'>1097</span>“THOSE whom you see yonder,” continued
he, “those wasted, emaciated spirits,
are the souls of the Envious—they are
doomed to view the most beautiful fruit,
which they can never taste, and behold pleasures
which they can never enjoy. This punishment
is adjudged them because most of
those vile passions, by which men suffer themselves
to be ruled, bring real evil, for promised
good.</p>

<p class='c009'>“FOR this reason the all-wise Judge hath
ordered the same passions still to inflame
those ghosts, with which they were possessed
on earth—Observe yon despicable crew!—behold
the sin of Avrice!—those sordid
ghosts are the souls of Misers—Lo! they eye
their delightful bags with horrid pleasure;
and with a ghastly smile, brood over their
imaginary riches. Unable to carry their
wealth about with them, they are confined to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1098'>1098</span>one spot, and in one position. This infernal
joy is the source of their tortures, for behold
them start at every sound, and tremble at the
flitting of a shade. Thus are they doomed to
be their own tormentors—to pore over their
gold with immortal fear, apprehension, and
jealousy and to guard their ideal wealth with
tears of care, and the eyes of eternal watchfulness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“BEHOLD here,” continued my guide,
“the miserable division of Suicides!” “Unhappy
they!” added I, “who, repining at the
ills of life, raised the sacrilegious steel against
their own bosoms! How vain the reiterated
wish to again animate the breathless clay—to
breath the vital air—and to behold the
cheering luminary of Heaven!”—“Upbraid
me not—O my father!” cried a voice—I
looked up, and thought my son appeared
among them—immediately turning from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1099'>1099</span>so shocking a spectacle, I suddenly beheld my
once loved <em>Maria</em>—“O delight of my youth!
do I behold thee once more!—Let me hide
my sorrows in thy friendly bosom.” I advanced
towards her—but she flew from me
with scorn and indignation—“O speak!
<em>Maria!</em> speak to me!” She pointed with
her finger to a group of spirits, and was out
of sight in a moment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“LET me,” said my conductor, “prepare
you for a more dreadful sight.” The increasing
melancholy, and affecting gloom of the
situation, forboded something terrifying to
my soul—I looked toward the place where
<em>Maria</em> had pointed, and saw a number of
souls remote from any division of the unhappy.
In their countenances were depicted
more anguish, sorrow and despair—I turned
my head immediately from this dreadful
sight, without distinguishing the nature of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1100'>1100</span>their torments. Quivering with horrour, I
inquired who they were—“These,” answered
my guide, with a sigh, “are the miserable
race of SEDUCERS.—Repentance and
shame drive them far from the rest of the
accursed. Even the damned look on them
with horrour, and thank fate their crimes
are not of so deep a die.”</p>

<p class='c009'>HE had hardly finished, when a demon
took hold of me and furiously hurried me in
the midst of this unhappy group—I was so
terrified that it immediately aroused me from
my sleep.—</p>

<p class='c009'>EVEN now, while I write to you, my good
friend, my hand trembles with fear at the
painful remembrance—Yet</p>

<div class='c013'><em>Boston.</em></div>

<p class='c012'>MUST I then forget the endearments
of the lover, and call you by the
name of brother? But does our friendship
remain upon this foundation? Is this all
that unites us? And has there subsisted
nothing more tender—a sentiment more
voluntary in our hearts? My feelings affirm
that there was. At the hour of our first interview
I felt the passion kindle in my breast.
Insensible of my own weakness, I indulged
its increasing violence and delighted in the
flame that fired my reason and my senses.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1102'>1102</span>Do you remember our walks, our conversation,
our diversions?—The remembrance of
these things fill my mind with inconceivable
torture—they seem to reproach me with unmerited
criminality—I deprecate, I detest all
these scenes of gaiety and frivolity—yet I
have preserved my innocence and my virtue—what
then have I to deprecate, what have
I to detest?</p>

<p class='c009'>ALAS! how have we been forming
schemes of happiness, and mocking our
hearts with unsubstantial joys. Farewel!
farewel! ye gilded scenes of imagination.
How have we been deluded by visionary
prospects, and idly dwelt upon that happiness
which was never to arrive.  How fleeting
have been the days that were thus employed!—when
anticipation threw open the gates of
happiness, and we vainly contemplated the
approach of bliss; and we beheld in reversion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1103'>1103</span>the pleasures of life, and fondly promised ourselves,
one day to participate in them; when
we beheld in the magick mirrour of futurity,
the lively group of loves that sport in the
train of joy. We observed in transports of
delight the dear delusion, and saw them, as it
were, in bodily form pass in review before us;
as the fabled hero views the region of præexistant
spirits, and beholds a race of men yet
to be born.</p>

<p class='c009'>SUCH was our hope, but even this fairy
anticipation was not irrational. We were
happy in idea, nor was the reality far behind.
And why is the vision vanished? O! I sink,
I die, when I reflect—when I find in my
<em>Harrington</em> a brother—I am penetrated
with inexpressible grief—I experience uncommon
sensations—I start with horrour at
the idea of incest—of ruin—of perdition.</p>

<p class='c009'>HOW do I lament this fatal discovery,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1104'>1104</span>that includes the termination of a faithful
love! I think of him whom I have resolved
to be eternally constant—and ah! how often
have I resolved it in my heart. I indulge, in
idea, the recollection of his caresses—of his
protestations, and of his truth and sincerity—I
become lost in a wilderness, and still I travel
on, and find myself no nearer an escape. I
cherish the dear idea of a lover—I see the
danger and do not wish to shun it, because to
avoid it, is to forget it—And can I, at one
stroke, erase from my mind the remembrances
of all in which my heart used to delight? Ah!
I have not the fortitude—I have not the virtue,
to “forget myself to marble.” On the
contrary, I strive no longer to remember our
present connexion. I endeavour to forget—I
curse the idea of a brother—my hand refuses
to trace the word, and yet</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>——The name appears</div>
      <div class='line'>Already written; blot it out my tears!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1105'>1105</span>AH, whence this sorrow that invests my
soul! This gloom that darkens—this fire
of impassioned grief, that involves all my
thoughts! why do I rave, and why do I
again abandon myself to despair! Come,
O <em>Harrington</em>! be a friend, a protector, a
brother—be him, on whom I could never yet
call by the tender, the endearing title of <em>parent</em>.
I will reverence him in whom all the
charities of life are united—I will be dutiful
and affectionate to you, and you shall be unto
me as a father—I will bend on the knee of respect
and love, and will receive your blessing.</p>

<p class='c009'>WHY did you go away so soon? Why
leave me when I was incapable of bidding
you adieu? When you pressed my cheek
with the kiss of love, of fraternal affection
what meant its conscious glow? What meant
the ebullition of my veins, the disorder of my
nerves, the intoxication of my brain, the blood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1106'>1106</span>that mantled in my heart? My hand trembled,
and every object seemed to swim before
my doubtful view—Amidst the struggle of
passion, how could I pronounce the word—how
could I call you by the title of brother?
True—I attempted to articulate the sound,
but it died upon my tongue, and I sank
motionless into your arms.</p>

<p class='c009'>ALLIED by birth, and in mind, and similar
in age—and in thought still more intimately
connected, the sympathy which bound
our souls together, at first sight, is less extraordinary.
Shall we any longer wonder at
its irresistible impulse?—Shall we strive to
oppose the <em>link of nature</em> that draws us to
each other? When I reflect on this, I relapse
into weakness and tenderness, and become
a prey to warring passions. I view you
in two distinct characters: If I indulge the
idea of one, the other becomes annihilated,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1107'>1107</span>and I vainly imagine I have my choice of a
brother or—</p>

<p class='c009'>I AM for a while calm—but alas! how
momentary is that calmness; I dwell with
rapture on what fancy has represented; but
is the choice regulated by virtue? Is it
prompted by reason? I recollect myself, and
endeavour to rouse my prudence and fortitude;
I abhor my conduct, and wish for obscurity
and forgetfulness. Who can bear the
torment of fluctuating passion? How deplorable
is the contest? The head and the
heart are at variance, but when Nature pleads
how feeble is the voice of Reason? Yet,
when Reason is heard in her turn, how criminal
appears every wish of my heart? What
remorse do I experience? What horrours
surround me? Will my feeble frame, already
wasted by a lingering decline, support these
evils? Will the shattered, frail bark outride
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1108'>1108</span>the tempest, and will the waves of affliction
beat in vain? Virtue, whose precepts I have
not forgotten, will assist me—if not to <em>surmount</em>,
at least to <em>suffer</em> with fortitude and
patience.</p>

<p class='c009'>OH! I fear, I fear my decaying health—If
I must depart, let me beseech you to forget
me—I know the strength of your passion,
and I dread the fatal consequences my departure
may occasion you.</p>

<p class='c009'>ONCE more let me intreat you, my dear
friend, to arm yourself with every virtue
which is capable of sustaining the heaviest
calamity. Let the impetuosity of the lover’s
passion be forgotten in the undisturbed quietness
of the brother’s affection, and may all
the blessings that life can supply be yours—Seek
for content, and you will find it, even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1109'>1109</span>though we should never meet again in this

<p class='c011'><em>Harrington</em> to <em>Worthy</em>.</p>

<p class='c012'>INGRATITUDE is a predominant
principle in the conduct of man. The perfidious —, who
owes to me his reputation and
fortune, and with whom I intrusted a great
part of my property, has deceived me. The
affair will materially retard my business.</p>

<p class='c009'>TO be unfortunate in trade is not worth a
sigh—to receive inattention and incivility
does not merit a frown; but <em>Ingratitude</em>—it
is this that cuts to the quick. Yet I freely
give him my pity; for what man, who considered
for a moment the inconsistency of
the human heart, would hurl the thunderbolt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1115'>1115</span>of indignation at the head of an ingrate?
What an important little thing is man! he
contrives to over-reach his neighbour, and
mount to the enjoyment of riches, ambition
and splendour; but remember not the period
of enjoyment—that his life is a day, and his
space a point!</p>

<p class='c009'>NATURALISTS inform us of insects
whose term of existence is confined to a few
hours—What is the business and importance
of such a life?</p>

<p class='c009'>WOULD not a being, whose <em>circle of living</em>
is immensity of ages, inquire with equal propriety:
“What is the importance of <em>man</em>—What
actions can he perform—What happiness
can he enjoy, whose insignificant life is
circumscribed to seventy years?”—In this
point of view I behold the tinsel, the vanity
and noise of the world, and the little plots
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1116'>1116</span>and cunning artifices of mankind to cheat
and ruin one another.</p>

<p class='c009'>INGRATITUDE, then, is constitutional,
and inseparable from human nature, but it
ought not to fill us with surprize, because it
is no new discovery—It has ever been invariably
the characteristick of man. Is not the
page of antiquity distained with blood of
those who ought to have received honour and
adoration? Behold the brilliant race of the
world’s benefactors: Consider their benevolent
actions, and regard their ungrateful return—these
benefactors, who have been sent
from Heaven to inform and entertain mankind,
to defend the world from the arm of
tyranny, and to open the gates of salvation,
have been despised, and banished, and poisoned
and crucified.</p>

<p class='c009'>BEHOLD the support of the <em>Roman</em>
power, the invincible <em>Belisarius!</em> who protected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1117'>1117</span>his country from the ravage of the
<em>Huns</em>, and displayed the <em>Roman</em> eagle in
every quarter of the globe! Behold him fall
a sacrifice to malice, to faction and ingratitude!
Behold him cast out by the country
he had defended, and for which he had wasted
his life to protect and honour, and left alone
to deplore his unfortunate condition, when he
was old, and blind, and naked and miserable!</p>

labour—what toil—what pain must be endured
in traversing the thorny paths that lead
to her blessed abode?—And will she not
receive me in those happy regions with as
much joy—with as sincere a welcome—if
I cut short my journey?—And will not the

desire of living is extinguished. What I formerly
esteemed trifles, and would not deign
to term misfortunes, now appear with a formidable

them harmless, and innoxious to my peace,
they assume new terrours every day.—But

principles.</p>

<p class='c009'>REMEMBER the story of the old man,

had come into a new order of beings, but

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1127'>1127</span>LET us watch over all we do with an eye

<p class='c012'>HOW vain is the wish that
sighs for the enjoyment of worldly happiness.
Our imagination dresses up a phantom to
impose on our reason: As Pygmalion loved
the work of his own hand—so do we fall in
love with the offspring of our brain. But
our work illudes our embrace—we find no
substance in it—and then fall a-weeping
and complain of disappointment. Miserable
reasoners are we all.</p>

<p class='c009'>WHY should I mourn the loss of <em>Harriot</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1130'>1130</span>any longer? Such is my situation—in
the midst of anxiety and distress, I complain

of the storm, bewails her drowned lover.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Worthy</em> to <em>Harrington</em>.</p>
<div class='c013'><em>Belleview.</em></div>

<p class='c012'>I THANK you for your letters,
but I wish you had something better for the
subject of them—the sad repetition of your
feelings and sorrows, pains me exceedingly—I
promise to be with you soon—perhaps before
you can receive this letter.</p>

<p class='c009'>WHATEVER concerns my friend, most
sensibly affects me—You, <em>Harrington</em>, are
the friend of my heart, and nothing has so
much grieved me as the story of your misfortunes.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1132'>1132</span>IT is a maxim well received, and seems to
be admitted an article in the moral creed of
mankind, “that the enjoyments of life do not
compensate the miseries.” Since, then, we
are born to suffer, and pain must attend us
in all the stages of our journey, let us philosophically
welcome our companion. The most
eligible plan we can adopt, is to be contented
in the condition that Providence hath assigned
us. Let us trust that our burden will
not be heavier than we can bear—When we
adopt this plan, and are sensible we have
this trust, our lesson is complete—we have
learned all—we are arrived to the perfection
of sublunary happiness.</p>

<p class='c009'>DO not think I am preaching to you a
mere sermon of morality—let me impress
your mind with the folly of repining, and the
blessing of a contented mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>LET me intreat you not to puzzle your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1133'>1133</span>brain with vain speculations—if you are disposed
to argue, do not put foolish cases that
never existed—take the light of facts, and
reason from them.</p>

<p class='c009'>WHEN we are surrounded with miseries
of life—the baseness of false friends—the
malice of enemies—when we are enveloped
in those anxious fears, the result of too much
sensibility, human nature feels a degree of
oppression, which, without a manly exertion
of reason and this practical philosophy,
would be intolerable. I have heard you mention
<span class='sc'>St. Evremond</span> as a philosopher of this
kind. Arm yourself with his prudence and
fortitude—he, though in exile—though reduced
almost to penury, and labouring under
the disadvantages of a bad constitution, lived
to be a very old man; he established a course
of rational pleasures—for when the mind is
employed, we regret the loss of time—we
become avaricious of life.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1134'>1134</span>WHEN misfortunes come upon us without
these consolations, it is hard, I acknowledge,
to buffet the storm—it is then human frailty
is most apparent—there is nothing left to
hope—Reason is taken from the helm of
life—and Nature—helpless, debilitated
Nature—lost to herself, and every social
duty, splits upon the rocks of despair and
suicide. We have seen several examples of
this—By exploring and therefore shunning
the causes, let us avoid the catastrophe.</p>

<p class='c009'>THE pensive and melancholy will muse
over the ordinary accidents of life, and swell
them, by the power of imagination, to the heaviest
calamities. Hence we find a treacherous
friend will sensibly affect some men, and a
capricious mistress will destroy a real lover:
Hence people in misfortune frequently construe
the slightest inattention into neglect
and insult, and deem their best friends false
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1135'>1135</span>and ungrateful. The sting of ingratitude,
deeply pierces the heart of sensibility.</p>

<p class='c009'>THE passions and affections which govern
mankind are very inconsistent. Men, confined
to the humble walks of life, sigh for the
enjoyment of wealth and power, which, when
obtained, become loathsome—The mind unaccustomed
to such easy situation, is discontented,
and longs to be employed in those
things in which it was formerly exercised.</p>

<p class='c009'>THE greatest rulers and potentates become
unhappy—they wish for the charms of solitude
and retirement, which, when attained,
become more irksome than their former condition—<em>Charles</em>
the Fifth, of <em>Spain</em>, resolved
to taste the pleasures of a recluse life, by abdicating
the throne—he soon found his imagination
had deceived him, and repented of
the step he had taken. This lazy life, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1136'>1136</span>compared to the business and grandeur of a
court, became tasteless and insipid.—“The
day,” says a historian, “he resigned his crown
to his son, was the very day in which he repented
making him such a present.”</p>

<p class='c009'>IT is a great art to learn to be happy in the
state in which we are placed—I advise you
to mingle in the concerns of your acquaintances—be
cheerful and undisturbed, nor
give yourself up to those gloomy ideas which
lend only to make you more wretched—If
such obtrude themselves, avoid being alone—I
had rather been a dupe to my imagination
than sacrifice an hour’s calmness to my sensibility
or understanding. Determine to be
happy, and you will be so—</p>

<p class='c012'>I ARRIVED in town last evening—you
desire me to write you a statement

of my marriage with the amiable <em>Myra</em>—I
promised to obey—but how little do we
know of the termination or consequences of
the most probable event!</p>

<p class='c009'>I SAW my beloved—her eyes were yet
heavy and smarting with weeping for the
death of <em>Harriot</em>—and this, once the house
of joy and cheerfulness, is turned into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1140'>1140</span>house of mourning. My unfortunate friend
had just then fallen into a calm sleep, and it
was impossible to see him—it was what I
very much desired—but it was the wish of
the family that I should desist for the present—he
had not slept the evening before—he
had been heard walking across his chamber
all the night, with little intermission, oftentimes
talking to himself in a passionate tone
of voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>THIS melancholy account deeply affected
me—and I parted from my beloved, praying
Heaven to give her consolation, and to be
the support of my disordered friend.</p>

<p class='c009'>IT is with difficulty I bring myself to the
serious and the painful employment of being

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1141'>1141</span>EARLY this morning I was surprised with
a visit, from a gentleman, whom I had formerly
seen at <em>Myra’s</em>—it was the same neighbour
who informed <em>Harrington</em> of his affinity
to <em>Harriot</em>—he found a difficulty in his
utterance—he told me, with trembling lips,
my young friend <em>Harrington</em> was dead—“He
has killed himself,” said I—he asked
me if I had heard the news—I told him my
heart presaged it.</p>

<p class='c009'>WHEN any uncommon event happens to
us, we often have a presentiment of it—The
circumstances of his death are these:—At
midnight the gentleman heard the report of
the pistol, and went into the house—he
found the unhappy youth wheltering in his
blood—few signs of life remained—the ball
had entered his brain—the surgeon came,
but in a few hours he was cold. A few
friends were requested to attend—and this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1142'>1142</span>gentleman had called upon me, by desire of

<p class='c011'><em>Worthy</em> to Mrs. <em>Holmes</em>.</p>
<div class='c013'><em>Boston.</em></div>

<p class='c012'>WE have surmounted the performance
of the last scene of our tragedy,
with less difficulty and distress than I imagined.
Great numbers crowded to see the
body of poor <em>Harrington</em>; they were impressed
with various emotions, for their sympathizing
sorrow could not be concealed—Indeed
a man without sensibility exhibits no
sign of a soul. I was struck with admiration
at the observations of the populace, and the
justness of the character they drew of the deceased,
“Alas!” said one—“poor youth thou
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1149'>1149</span>art gone. Thou wast of a promising genius,
of violent passions, thou wast possessed of a
too nice sensibility, and a dread of shame. It
is only such an one who would take the
trouble to kill himself. Ah! poor well natured,
warm hearted, hot headed youth—how
my heart bleeds for you! We consider thee
as the dupe of <em>Nature</em>, and the sacrifice of
Seduction.” The old father hears this, and
becomes overwhelmed with shame and
sorrow.</p>

<p class='c009'>THE jury which sat upon the body of our
friend, after mature consideration, brought in
their verdict Suicide. The rigour of the law
was not executed—the body was privately
taken away, and I saw it deposited by the
side of his faithful <em>Harriot</em>.</p>

<p class='c009'>I SEND you inclosed a copy of the Monumental
Inscription, as written by <em>Harrington</em>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1150'>1150</span>I found it with many loose papers. It contains
the story of our unfortunate friends, and
a profitable moral is deduced from it.</p>

<p class='c009'>THOUGH a few weeks begin to spread
calm over our passions, yet the recollection of
our misfortunes will sometimes cause a momentary
agitation, as the ocean retains its
swell, after the storms subsides.</p>

      <div class='line'>And take this serious counsel to thy heart:</div>
      <div class='line'>Does some fair female of unspotted fame,</div>

      <div class='line'>Bid her detest the fell Seducer’s wiles,</div>

      <div class='line'>O’er the pale marble shall they join their heads,</div>
      <div class='line'>And drink the falling tears each other sheds,</div>

  <h2 class='c007'>Notes.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>For</span> many reasons it has been thought best to reprint
this book exactly after the original copy, “<span class='sc'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">VERBATIM ET
LITERATIM ET PUNCTUATIM</span></span>”; and although the modern
purist may feel offended at the archaisms of orthography,
syntax and punctuation—the last of which appears to
have been used with rhetorical and not grammatical significance—,
he must content himself with the fact that art
would have lost all and science gained nothing by the
rewriting of the above pages in the diction of today.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Out</span> of regard for the feelings of the descendants of
the originals of certain characters of the novel, who are
living today in Boston, the editor has decided to reveal
the identity only of those of the personæ who are
already known, to a more or less extent, through the literary
history of New England. Although curiosity
may turn away unsatisfied with the volume, yet the art
of it all remains through considering Harrington, father
and son, Maria and Harriot, and Mrs. Holmes nothing
more than types and not as individuals whose true biographies
are written.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Vol. I</span>, page 83, begins the story of “Martin” and
“Ophelia,” the real characters of which were recognized
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1154'>1154</span>at the time to be Mr. Perez Morton and his young
sister-in-law, Theodosia Francis Apthorp. In commenting
on this fact in the book, Sabin writes in his “Books
relating to America” (Vol. <span class='fss'>XV</span>, Page 377) “This work
created quite a sensation, and was suppressed by interested
parties. The names of Fanny Apthorp and
Perez Morton are not yet forgotten as connected with
the matter.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Perez Morton</span> was born at Plymouth, Nov. 13, 1751.
His father settled at Boston, and was keeper of the
White Horse Tavern, opposite Hayward-place, and died
in 1793. The Son entered the Boston Latin School in
1760, and graduated at Harvard College in 1771, when
he studied law; but the revolutionary war prevented his
engaging in the practice, and he took an active part in
the cause of freedom. In 1775 he was one of the
Committee of Safety, and in the same year became
deputy-secretary of the province. After the war, he
opened an office as an attorney at law, at his residence
in State-street, on the present site of the Union Bank.</p>

<p class='c009'>In 1777 he married Sarah Wentworth Apthorp, at
Quincy, noted by Paine as the American Sappho. Mr.
Morton was a leader of the old Jacobin Club, which held
meetings at the Green Dragon Tavern, and became a
decided Democrat. A political poet of Boston thus
satirizes Perez Morton:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Perez, thou art in earnest, though some doubt thee!</div>
      <div class='line'>In truth, the Club could never do without thee!</div>
      <div class='line'>My reasons thus I give thee in a trice,—</div>
      <div class='line'>You want their votes, and they want your advice!</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1155'>1155</span>“Thy tongue, shrewd Perez, favoring ears insures,—</div>
      <div class='line'>The cash elicits, and the vote secures.</div>
      <div class='line'>Thus the fat oyster, as the poet tells,</div>
      <div class='line'>The lawyer ate,—his clients gained the shells.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mr. Morton</span> was Speaker of the House from 1806
to 1811, and was attorney-general from 1810 to 1832;
was a delegate from Dorchester to the convention for
revising the State constitution, in 1820, and was vigorous
in general debate. He died at Dorchester, Oct.
14, 1837. He was an ardent patriot, an eloquent
speaker, of an elegant figure and polished manners.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>This</span> Mansion, (the home of “Worthy,” later the city
residence of Mr. Perez Morton) as enlarged and embellished
by its honoured proprietor, the late Charles Apthorp,
Esq. was then, that is, about the middle of the
Eighteenth Century, said to be the scene of every elegance,
and the abode of every virtue. Now, (1823) its
beautiful hall of entrance, arches, sculpture, and bas-relief;
the grandstair-case, and its highly finished saloon,
have been removed, or partitioned off, to accommodate
the bank and its dependencies.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Thomas Wentworth</span> Earl of Strafford, the Minister,
and favourite of Charles the First, sacrificed by that
Monarch to his own personal safety—was beheaded
near the end of the reign. Charles, in his last moments,
declared that he suffered justly for having given up the
Earl of Strafford to popular fury.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>The</span> near Relations of this Nobleman were the
founders of the American Family of Wentworth. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1156'>1156</span>family being presumptive heirs to the now extinct Title
of that Earldom of Strafford.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>These</span> were Henry and Samuel Wentworth, the maternal
uncles of the Author, both perished before they
had attained the age of twenty. The first, on a northern
voyage of curiosity and improvement, was entangled
amid floating masses of ice, and in that situation expired
along with the whole ship’s company, passengers
and seamen.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>His</span> young brother, Samuel Wentworth, having been
invited to England by his noble relatives, was under the
patronage of those, admitted as student at the Temple;
at which period he first met Miss Lane, the object of
his honourable passion, and the cause of his fatal misfortune,
the daughter of a great commercial house of
that period. Her large inheritance, by her father’s will,
made dependent on the pleasure of her mercantile
brother, to the aristocracy of whose wealth, young Wentworth
could only oppose nobility of birth, accomplishment
of mind and beauty of person, possessions which
the man of commerce held as nothing, compared with
the superior treasures of monied interest.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Consequently</span> the love was prohibited, and the
lover banished from his mistress; who though closely
imprisoned in her own apartment, found means to preserve
an epistolary connection. The correspondence
increasing the enthusiasm of restricted passion, until
every possible hope of their union being extinguished,
a deadly vial was obtained, and the contents, equally
divided, were at one desperate moment swallowed by
both. Their last desire, of being buried in the same
grave, was denied.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1157'>1157</span><span class='sc'>These</span> frantic and too affectionate lovers, finished the
short career of their miseries on the birth day of Wentworth,
being that which completed the nineteenth year of
his age. And it is not irrelevant to add, that the
brother of the lady lived to lose his immense possessions,
and died desolate and distressed; at which
period, we trust, repentance came, and forgiveness was
awarded.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>John</span>, the founder of the transatlantic race of Apthorp,
was a man of taste and talent in the Fine Arts;
particularly those of Painting and Architecture. A
taste and talent, which has in some instance been transmitted
to his descendants even of the fifth generation.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>An</span> ardent imagination, and an ambitious desire of
mental improvement, led him from his native country of
Wales. And in England, he saw, loved, and married,
Miss Ward, a celebrated beauty, with a large fortune,
whose Portrait, by Sir Peter Lely, yet remains with her
descendant. This portrait is distinguished by the long
dark eyes, which that artist preferred and made fashionable.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>The</span> qualities of both parents live, and are conspicuous
in some of their descendants. A highly respectable
individual of these, whose superiority of mind may
possibly disdain such recollections, was, in his minority,
so transcendently handsome, that upon a Tour through
the Southern States, he was generally designated “The
Eastern Angel.” As he now is, the Genius of Canova
might design that form as a model for the sublime
statue of melancholy, since his fortunes have fallen—like
those of his race—a voluntary sacrifice to the best
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1158'>1158</span>sentiments, and the noblest feelings of humanity, while
domestic bereavements coming yet nearer to his gracious
heart have left it the prey of sorrow.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Charles Bulfinch</span>, Esq. of Washington, at this
time (1823,) the National Architect, is one more evidence
of the inestimable happiness of a good descent.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>The</span> present <span class='sc'>Stone Chapel</span> (corner of School and
Tremont Streets)—originally the <span class='sc'>King’s Chapel</span>—founded
by Royalty, was finished by the generosity of
individuals. Charles Apthorp, Esq. the son of John, gave
5000l. sterling, a very large sum for the Provinces at that
period, about the middle of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>His</span> Marble Monument with a very fine Latin Inscription,
by his Son, still remains in the Chapel, which
Monument covers the Tomb of the truly noble-minded
race of Apthorp.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>The</span> Crest, if not the whole Armorial Bearing, is
thought or said to have been conferred upon the Battle
Field by Richard.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>The</span> shield of the Apthorp arms, which bearing a
<span class='fss'>MULLET</span> or spur, in heraldry, with truly Welsh prepossession,
the family were fondly, perhaps foolishly, wont

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Belleview</span> was undoubtedly the Apthorp homestead
at Quincy where Mrs. Morton passed her youth.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1159'>1159</span><span class='sc'>In</span> the Rev. Mr. Holmes, Quincy antiquarians will
readily recognize the Rev. Dr. Greenleaf, whose religious
and philosophical teachings undoubtedly had great influence
on the author who was to come so near being
his biographer.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
